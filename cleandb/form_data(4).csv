I enjoy all of LIOS articles and emails.  But I am not able to attend conferences at this point.
I heard some conflicting information about getting a Hungarian passport.  Is it 300000 Euros in government bonds that will be returned in 5 years and pass a language test with NO residency requirement?  How safe is Hungarian government bonds?  I visited Hungary and liked it very much but am worried about the language test.
I am also considering Portrugal but it seems to require a bigger investment.
Does Croatia offer investment passport program as well?
My final question: would an international health insurance be enough to carry in all the European countries? 
Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you

1. Stanford
2. Coaccess
3. Financial Pacific
4. Balboa Bank and Trust
5. Thales Securities
6. FPB Bank
Expats trusting any Panamanian bank are trusting their financial futures to a system that is driven by corruption and vindictive ego driven politicos. They all take turns being taken out by the SMV   where such actions are often based on allegations of impropriety with little or no actual proof.

I opened an account at Banvivienda in David shortly after getting my Panamanian cedula about 2 years ago. It took maybe a half hour and I walked out with a deposit book and internet access. Because of the implosion of Panama Wall Street and all of the regulators involved I need an account in the name of my Belizean IBC (which held the account @ PWS). I have been working on this for more than a year. I have tried Capital Bank (introduced by a friend and businessman with 'connections' there); Banvivienda where I already have an account; ScotiaBank with introduction from a Panamanian lawyer; and Canal Bank with introduction from PWS who claimed to have influence on the process and ""an account can be opened very quickly."" To date NOT ONE of these banks has allowed me to open an account. The usual story is after submitting 10-30 pages of application forms (in Spanish) and at least an equal number of supporting documents the agent just stops returning emails. Since I live in Bocas travel to either David or Panama City is a major hassle but even meeting face to face with the various agents has been fruitless.
I cannot attend your conference (I have a commitment to take some family members sailing in the San Blas) I would LOVE to get the info on the bank you mentioned who might actually be able to help me.
Thanks - and feel free to share my experiences with the group. (I have been coming to Panama since 2004 got my pensionado in 2009 and my cedula in 2014. I have a house on Isla Solarte Bocas del Toro.)",2017-02-13,,offshore-site-contact-form

I have followed you since several years and very much appreciate your many pieces of advice you have given to your readers.
4 years ago I purchased on the advice of Lief Simon four 5 ac parcels in the lovely eco community of Los Arboles in Tulum Mexico. There is no structure on any of them. I have made several trips to this location and still love the extraordinary beauty and serenity of this gated eco community the nearby ocean with its famous beaches and the ancient Maya temples and old culture of the area. It is also a major sports paradise attracting international visitors.
My life has changed and I live currently away from the US in Ecuador. I did contact a local realtor regarding selling 3 of my plots but he claims to be very busy and rarely communicate.
I was thinking you may be quite connected in Mexico in terms of knowing reliable realtors. May I ask you for any advice and a recommendation of a realtor in the Tulum area? I would greatly appreciate it.

I love all of your information thank you! I am spoiled for choice with my next move. I am 49 have a healthy enough pension to move anywhere in Latin America comfortably. I am looking for a beach town with a lot of expats great wifi and a place I can live for $2000 per month which would allow me to save a lot of money monthly.

Belize being english speaking is attractive but I assume life on the Caye's may move north of $2k in living expenses a month. I hope to rent a furnished condo with a good ocean view wherever I end up.

Wherever you suggest approximately how long would it take from the time of application to get whatever pensionado visa I may qualify for?

Thank you again!

We understand that it is in our best interest to find someone independent of our buyers agent.  Do you agree?    We wonder about transfering money to Forex & not finding our dream apartment thus not getting a bank account to receive it.    No interest would be paid by Forex & they could just transfer it back at the current exchange rate (where they make their money on the difference between buy & sell).

I'm 56 years of age single and planning on retiring at 66.  I have a net worth of about $750K but most of my cash is tied up in IRAs/401Ks/Cash value Life insurance (I add about $46K to these a year) plus my home.   I do have a defined pension plan that I will be receiving upon retirement.  Can you suggest which of the investment options I should consider looking at more closely?

His nephew a taxi driver was shot in the back of his head. My friend said this is typical of Panama today.
The public schools are close to the worst in the world and Panamanians do not much like ExPats and will rip you off if they can primarily because a good 40% live at or below the poverty level.
We lived there for 4 years and experienced several difficult situations  due to the prevailing negative attitudes. We are glad we lived there and we are glad we don't now.
So be honest and upfront. Nothing I've read from your website has really and honestly touched in depth the ugly negatives. Just sort of skimmed by them.
Thanks

91191,156,Nancy Patterson,njpatterson@verizon.net,,,USA,"Hi Lee (or whoever responds to this).  My husband and I retirees in our 60s have decided after much traveling that we would like to live part time in Spain and we will be traveling there again this spring for an extended time to get an idea of which area we would like to live in. We are not rushing into anything.  On this trip we will focus on areas near the southern coast (east of Malaga) and near the eastern coast from around Alicante all the way up into northern Catalunya.  When we narrow our choices down we will rent in an area or two for several months before buying.
Are there real estate agents in some of these areas (Velez-Malaga to Almeria Alicante Valencia Tarragona Girona) you could recommend to us who would be willing to talk to and possibly show properties to visitors who are prospective renters and buyers but not at this time?  We are looking eventually for a house in a decent-sized town that is not a resort and that is close enough to a large city to get there by public transit or car in about 20 to 40 min. Our trip when we rent for several months will most likely be next fall.  
And if you have any favorite areas that fit our description that you think we should visit on this trip just to check out the area please let us know that as well as the contact info for some helpful realtors.
Thank you.

It's not very safe if you ask me. What would you recommend? Are banks reliable enough to have several thousand dollars USD on hand on demand? (we go through over $20k each spring with the group...)

91372,356,Robert Young,docyoung99@comcast.net,USA 510-329-3543,,,"Hi Leif
I am a long time subscriber of your and Kathleen's materials.  Love your publications!   And your business model is superb.  You make a fortune in repeat business by freely allowing the 100% - no questions asked - guarantee.  In the business of information selling this is a vital element to multiplying your sales potential to you current customers.  I've had to use it when I purchased duplicate info from you... however it made it a no-brainer when it came time for me figure if I should purchase some new item you offered.  (Much easier to generate income from happy current clients than to generated new business from new clients.) From my direct experience in nationwide retail marketing the ""keep verses new customer dollar ratio"" is anywhere between 10:1 to 50:1 or greater depending on how you crunch the numbers.  That is you are making about $10 - $50 more against advertising to your current clients for every $1 you would be making by generating a new client all advertising and marketing costs being the same for each.   I could go into this is infinite detail if you ever want to chat up the subject.  

 I'm need to have a separate conversation with you folks about your Panama residential project.  I AM purchasing a second/third home within the next 2-3 years and Panama is first on my list.  

But I digress. 

To the question.
Subject: IRS-USA government reporting for offshore income - specifically income from FARM property managed by a property manger and also income derived from residential/commercial rentals.   

From what you mentioned to me a few years ago you also purchased the same farmland in Brazil.  You provided feedback regarding our potential purchase of some Neem and Coconut plots from Liquid Investments - Anthony Archer and Andrew Goodman.  I appreciated your candid POV.  Thank you again.  We went forward with the investment.  I hold some plots in a self-directed IRA my name only...  a majority of the real estate is in a ROTH and a smaller percentage is in a Traditional IRA (the holdings in the Traditional IRA will ultimately be converted to ROTH but not before some income is generated in the Traditional IRA).  I will be creating an LLC type structure or Trust to hold the IRA property.  Whether or not the LLC or Trust will be created before the first payouts are received by the custodian is unknown at this time.   That should NOT be a problem with tax reporting as the income from the property managers AND will be paid directly to the US based custodian (Equity Trust Company of Ohio) from Liquid Investment Company (Anthony and Andrew's company).  If there is anything I should know about that side of the investment please feel free to let me know.

However my wife and I hold some plots that are due to be begin being paid out in 2017 and 2018.  They are currently hold jointly as Robert Young and Lynda Young US citizens et. al.   We are definitely going to create an LLC or Trust structure at the same time as I create on for the IRA.

My tax guy was asking about the account that the money is coming from.  And if we  Bob and Lynda have to report Liquid Investment's account information as we will theoretically have a vested interest (what-have-you) in Liquid Investment's account that they will be accumulating the property owners in before they distribute the income to their clients.   Obviously we own the property outright.   Obviously we are hiring Liquid Investment to manage the property and pay Brazilian taxes and operating costs and deduct Liquid Investment's property management fee from the proceeds derived from the agricultural process derived from the property WE own.   But the question is... do Bob and Lynda have to report Liquid's account information??   The same question would apply to a property management company handling a residential real estate situation; would it not?   Please advise. OR let me know who is a reputable tax wiz in this area OR do you have a Tax Manual that you sell?

Thanks so much for your time.
Sincerely
Bob Young

a few questions on this deal for the fractional ownership option.   once the investment is made  what is the payment schedule for the 15% construction period  return?  that is how long would it be before the income stream starts and what is the frequency.   is the 15% a net return or are there some expenses deducted?      similarly once the resort is operational  what would the payment schedule be for the 7% minimum or 50% of net revenue?     also  can the fractional ownership options be resold?   how would any presumed capital appreciation be handled?

91649,156,Drew Nelles,dnelles@gmail.com,,,Canada/Vietnam,"Dear Matt

I just read your article on Ottawa and as a Canadian and former Ontarian I feel the need to point out a few things. 

Ottawa is located (just) in the Province of Ontario home of the liberal Wynn government a government with the largest sub-national debt in the world making California look well off.  Premier Wynn is a friend Jerry Brown and so far left she makes Nancy Pelosi look like Rush Limbaugh's ideological twin. There will be some great bargains in Ontario after the crash and burn of the economy but not right now. I'd strongly advise waiting a few years.

If you must go to Canada try PEI or Nova Scotia - close to Maine and Boston and with good bargains too if you look and a less precarious provincial government although not too great a place to look for a job at least locally. 

But as Canada has lots of snow and ice (Ottawa is cold enough to freeze a can of coke solid overnight if left in the car) I would recommend something warmer and far cheaper like Vietnam where I am now. 100m2 here in Hanoi is US$100000 or less in a brand new high end apartment and foreigners can buy now. There's a local Harley Davidson dealership and Rolls Royce BMW and Mercedes dealerships too here in Hanoi if you care. Hondas and Toyotas are here for the rest of us too. A meal costs a $2 20 aspirins $0.10 a bus ride $0.30 rent is $300/mo for the above 100m2. High Speed Internet Cable TV (HBO included) together are $150 per *year*. Water and electricity are $20/mo in the winter and $50 in the summer (A/C).

Just worth pointing out I think and at best please warn anyone moving to Ottawa about the provincial issues. They aren't to be taken lightly. ",2017-03-01,,

Love the articles on Portugal. I lived there for over 16 years and agree with everything you wrote. However I was wondering why you don't list Porto along with Lisbon and the Algarve region? It has been elected the top European tourist place for 3 years and is just as accessible as Lisbon. Another place is the third largest city Braga which has a charm of its own and is close to beaches (45 min) and mountains (40 min). Just a suggestion.",2017-03-05,,

92141,156,Keith Threlfall,keithth1940@gmail.com,,,UK,Hi Lee Boy did your article hit home! So well put. Just one thing ommitted which for many retired expats living outside the US and directly affecting their cost of living is Soc ial Security! Paid at a fixed dollar rate but fine if strong when converted to local currency. Bad part is that when you budget for x pounds with a strong dollar and then the dollar collapses big shock. So retirement income is greatly affected by currency fluctuations as well as property value. I bought a flat here in the UK for 150000 pounds a year ago at a rate of 1.385. Now the rate is 1.2150 a loss of $25500. The problem confronting everyone wishing to reside overseas and purchase a property is do you buy now or do you wait for a better exchange rate which may never happen and you lose the property. Catch 22. As you pointed out this will apply to anyone going to a country which is not dollar denominated. So does that limit one's choice of where to live? Possibly especially if you are already retired.,2017-03-08,,

92147,94,Claude,cpfitness@gmail.com,,,USA,"Hi Kathleen
I'm subscribed to your newsletters and Lief's. I sent this email earlier today not sure who it would reach so I'm sending it to you as well:

Lief and Kathleen have incredibly awesome information to make the world take notice. However you absolutely need to stop making it so inconvenient for Americans (and you know darn well Americans are your biggest market) to attend your events. Sometimes I actually have to wonder if you are doing this on purpose?

No I have zero interest in going to panama nicaragua or columbia. I'm French born in Paris and I have zero desire to go there either to attend a seminar as the country has as many liabilities as the US. has. For many of the same reasons the US is no longer desirable France has matched America and surpassed it in many areas of absurdity. The France of 1960 I knew is just a distant memory just as is the California I knew when I arrived in 1965.

I am tickled pink however at the prospect of finding out everything I can about Belize about CostaRica and other places in the Caribbean so I can make an informed decision about which of these countries I would like to visit. This at my leisure on my terms in the time frame I decide and when airfares may be advantageous.

I want to learn more about diversification about investments about establishing a business. And no buying the videos of the summit is not like being there live allowing me to ask specific ?s particular to my situation.

Your events of themselves are already an investment please do not saddle the market that supports you with 45 or more times the cash outlay with airfare hotels car rentals restaurant food and other multiple incidentals that are sure to find their way in the final bill. Of course this is not even mentioning the time outlay that is unacceptable. 

The worst consideration is the prospect of dealing with an over-zealous TSA agent who wants to make a name for himself. Lief is familiar with this as evidenced by an earlier email mentioning entry refusal and interrogation. I find air travel today to be repulsive but a necessity so I'm not willing to gamble air travel for a destination I may not like. I want to find out the facts BEFOREHAND! Being onsite will NOT influence a hasty decision.

I suspect you naively imagine that your market demographic is the retired couple on SS that has just had enough and is looking for an alternative lifestyle and sane environment to escape to in their later years. You imagine they have disposable income and time that will allow them to go2 panama or the likes.

In fact I'm 64 a Triathlete a fitness trainer and massage therapist and I still actively train and race as I did when I was 30. I ski fly kayak and scuba dive. This later hobby is what I would love to develop into a business overseas- open a diving school in Belize and offer Scuba tours to a worldwide market. I plan on dying doing what I love to do not on a death-bed surrounded by family! 

I have a website and work on the internet I'm a seasonal lake Lifeguard with LosAngeles county and I have zero desire to ever retire. But I'm really interested in the information you have and would like to avail myself of it at a live event. But no I'll never travel to another country to find that out! It's just too inconvenient and time consuming.

On the west coast California is a hub for global seminars of all kinds of markets from financial to tourism. There are 100s of venues in SoCal from LosAngeles and environs (where I live) to SanDiego which is a jewel on the Pacific. Why you have decided to avoid this market is beyond me?

I realize I'm not the typical 64 year old by any means however if I've taken the time to write you this letter you can be certain there are dozens if not 100s of others subscribed to OverSeas Opportunity letter who have reasons of their own for not traveling overseas to attend your seminars. 

I don't think you have an accurate handle on your demographic and who composes it. 

Just thought you would like to hear from another perspective of interested subscribers  than the one you have considered by default.

I would also add that If you were to consider an event in LA I would offer my services to help it come to fruition.

Thank you
Claude Maugein.

Such as a pre-purchase of a project with some acceptable financing so I could leverage my investments.  I am looking at this as a place where I could purchase and resell later - then work up my investment w/ you folks along with having a nice place to live!!   I am going to have a good ROTH IRA income$$ starting next year that could sustain a short term finance situation.   The income will grow significantly over the next 5 years so I am looking at something where I can make an income too(rentals).  The ROTH is kind of my ""tax free"" growth project :) .   I have personal $$ available to buy personal investments/home. What stage is the project today?   Obviously it is considered in stages and (obviously) progress would be based on completed sales of each part of the project.  ON THE MAP you will be sending me can you please give me a timeline (for each part of the project) when the start of the construction is planned and when the completion is planned for.  I'm trying to get a feel for the stages which I can purchase/rent and live in the different parts of Los Islotes.  Path of progress and timing. I would believe that there is a realistic and most valuable ""path of progress"" within the project.

After all is said and done (as I ramble on) I want -1) a place for my wife and I to comfortable live.  Size location will obviously depend on pricing.  Idea would be single level home near beach.  Cheap home in expensive neighborhood has worked VERY well for me in the past. That last statement is relative to the project.  In Beverly Hills a 6K foot house in a neghborhodd of 12k sq ft homes appreciates well. 
#2) is rental property or place for my son... A rentable studio in a rentable area of 2-3 bedroom condos can be great IF it is rentable an the location/price is correct.  I've seen Casitas sell in Belize for $99k pre-construction and resell (including the builders new construction) go for double that . bedroom condo  months later.

Anyway...  Send me what yo can and try to get me interested.   I think this may be a great project but I need to get a feel for the commitment of the builder and investors to make sure I'm not dumping my $ into a nice home in a vacant project in  years from now.   If I don't pick up on my phone (crappy cell service were I live sometimes) Let me know whe yo are available and leave your PHONE and let me know IF IT IS A UA phone # .  If not I will get a phone card with Panama rates.   I don't want  phone bill to chat with you about thw project.    I chatted w/ Steven the other day about avocados-mangos-etc.  I'm already an investor in Brazilian farmland and am NOW looking at making sure my profits have a safe and expansive home in the near future.

Sory to make this so long but I ""kick the tires"" pretty extensively prior to parting with my cash.  Looking forward to you PDFs and other material.  And a follow up phone call would be cool too.

-Take care.
Regards... Bob Young  -

Your story about CPA's doing taxes is certainly true. As a college student I worked as a first level tax examiner for the IRS.  Returns done by CPA's had among the highest rates of being flagged for higher level examination or being returned for missing forms. At least the H&R Block folk included all the necessary forms-they may not have taken all the possible legal deductions but at least they rarely messed up by not transferring figures accurately from one form to the next or just omitting some forms. Now I am retired (electrical engineering) living in Boquete and still doing my taxes myself. In two weeks we will have been in our home here for five years. Six years ago I went to your(s and Kathleen's) Panama Conference and we haven't looked back. Our daughter is visiting right now for her 9th visit - she loves it here.

I also want to buy a condo there that I can rent out through Airbnb during the time I'm not there as well as 2 of the bedrooms even during the time I am there.  My questions are:
1) what do you think of the area between Laureles and Belen?  An apartment (condo) I'm considering is on the border of those 2 communities
2) would I pay Colombian taxes on the rental income or US taxes or both/neither
3) I'm setting up a brokerage account with a Colombian company to transfer my dollars to pesos and they go through Citibank of NY.  Does that sound like the normal process?

Thanks

92296,156,Cletis Weitnauer,dcicletis@yahoo.com,,,USA,"Hi Lee
I am eyeing my retirement future outside the USA.  I think Mexico has something to offer mostly based on proximity to the USA and time zone concerns.

My question is regarding the price of real estate today in Mexico.  It is not clear to me if the devalued peso offers any price advantage to a buyer with USD ?  I am interested in  any city with a beach and access to good health care. Mazatlan PV or Cabo would fit my description I think

Has real estate become more affordable due to the peso devaluation or are these types of properties priced in USD and thus continue to track as such ?  How about locations inland ? A city such as Pueblo or Cuernavaca ?

Any other location advise is appreciated.

Kind Regards

I am currently writing this from Medellin Colombiia where we have  spend our winters for the last six years.  In the city as in many of the other cities on your real estate beat properties are priced in American dollars. You make it sound because the dollar is doing so well  compared to the local currency that real estate is a bargain here. From where I sit with the prices of real estate in the city priced  in American dollars how does one reap the benefit of the strength of the US greenback?  Richard Doggett Iowa ,2017-03-15,,

92403,94,Steve Kramer,stevekrrt@gmail.com,,,Belize/DR,"Hi Kathleen
I am registered for your 3 day event in the Dominican Republic in May. I have a company Green Survival Solutions that markets off grid energy solutions with a food production component. I have a low head cross flow hydroelectric generator that produces a constant 1500-2000 watts of commercial grade electricity with very little head and flow required. This will be very much in demand in the DR according to a USACE hydrology report I am in possession of. I had spoken with your Belize Circle Liaison way back on August 15th last year regarding utilizing my generator and battery storage system for your project in Belize. He was also going to get back to me regarding collaboration with L&IO as far as marketing my services at your classes in exchange for a generous percentage of the sale as a referral fee. He was also going to inform me about your self-sufficiency seminar which is something that we could collaborate on as well but I never heard back from him. I emailed him on March 3rd inquiring if there was still any interest and requested  a reply from him but my correspondence has been overlooked. As Phil does not appear to be a reliable contact for initiating a working relationship with your organization I am appealing to you to provide me with another contact who may be more responsive and receptive to what I have to offer. I will look forward to discussing this further during the conference but I thought perhaps I would attempt to provide you with more information in advance in order to facilitate possible business contacts when in the DR in May. I will be staying an additional 2 weeks after the conference to try to get the ball rolling there. I think that the products and services I offer will be something that many expatriates living overseas could benefit greatly from. Please share your thoughts and advise me what you suggest as far as developing a better working relationship with L&IO. 
Respectfully

I have been so impressed with the pieces you've done on Portugal.  I am in my 50's and still working but beginning to wind down a large part of my business.  The Algarve sounds wonderful but you've sold me on Lisbon.  It seems Lisbon would have more activity to for a solo semi-retired traveller who is considering relocating.  I'm very active love beaches and into culture and history.  If I were to travel to Lisbon this Spring/Summer to ""investigate"" potential property purchase what are your favorite areas of Lisbon (or surrounding area) for purchase?  Thanks again for your great work!

I've had a fixed annuity with a Swiss insurer since 2009.
I received a small quarterly annuity in U.S.D.
All annuities have been payed   via wire transfer to my U.S. bank account.
Suddenly I find out that the insurer is no longer making payments to U.S. clients.
Can they do this?
I have an annuity contact (policy) with them.
What gives?
If they are unwilling to service my policy can I transfer the policy to another Swiss insurer?
 What other options would I have?
Thank you for your interest.

I invested $25K into the Cartagena Suites with First American Realty. Not sure if this was a good move as it is still not completed and getting ""long in the tooth"" as the saying goes and I have made 0 dollars almost the same as interest in a US bank! Lol

 My question is do I need to declare this investment on 8938 tax form or any other form?
It is an investment in a foreign LLC company doing business in real estate as they classified it. The investors are share holders.

My husband and I live in Panama currently on tourist Visas.  We have engaged an attorney to start our residency process with the Friendly Nations Visa (we are U.S. citizens).  Before we decided to pursue residency we were looking at 2 agricultural investments within Panama - the avocado farm investment that Invest Overseas recommends and a coffee farm in Boquete.  We are investing with funds from a U.S. based self-directed IRA.  Our attorney is uncomfortable with using these 2 property investments for residency because they will be held in an LLC in a SDIRA.  Do you know if this is something Panama would accept for residency?

I have a few questions:

1. We are trying to find out which is the best way to buy without us taking on the financial responsibility of the mortgage alone.  I heard of the option of a corporation in Mexico. Would that allow several couples listed who are purchasing the vacation home with us?

2. Do we apply in the US for a loan through any entity or are there specific companies we have to go through for a Mexican property?

I would greatly appreciate your feedback.

I'm currently working in China and have been reading your newsletters for a while now.
I am currently in the process of selling a property in Australia that I have a lot of equity in. I am looking at investing in some overseas real estate that will create a passive cash flow.

I have just read your email regarding the Passive Cash flow event you are conducting in Panama this week.  Is there any chance of getting that information by video or will you be doing a similiar conference later this year?

92695,94,Milan Nabeghi,swimtorelax@gmail.com,,,USA,"Hi Kathleen 
First of all Thank you sooo very much for the unique and  amazing information you and your team provide about retiring and investing Overseas.  

I am a US citizen with Persian (Iranian) origin and well traveled Lived mostly in Iran Spain and US.   Fluent in English Spanish Persian( Farsi) Azari and conversational French. 

I am being contacted almost on daily basis by friends relatives even strangers referred to me from  various countries specially Iran to give them advice about moving to another country due to unbearable political and social situation they have to put up with they would like to move someplace and retire or even invest. 

I have referred a lot of the English speaking  ones to your wonderful informative website. And the ones with poor English I have verbally translated your articles for them.

I am turning 62 in August  and I am thinking  about filing SSI and  moving overseas myself. I will most probably choose a Latin country since I speak the language And number one in my list is Panama.

I am an avid open water and lap swimmer So I do not want  to sit on a couch and watch movies yet I will be looking into starting a business or check into other opportunities And I think Panama can be the right place for me at least for now.

Would love to hear your feedback and guidance about my inquiry.

Best Regards
Milan Nabeghi

Investmentwatch Â 5.Â stevequayle 6. standeyo 7.trendsresearchÂ .....I am very concerned with the coming collapse  I am convinced that the economy willÂ  fall and fall badly those whoÂ rely on Social Security will learn Â to their dismay that those payments will stop altogether or severely cut backÂ Â .Â  Ether way people are going to be hurtÂ and unable to make ends meet.Â  Having this happenÂ in a foreign land is going to be terrifying to say the least.Â  I myself am a retired U.S. Army NCO.Â  So I also have My Military retirement pay to help my wife and I to live on as well as Social Security for the both of us.Â  Even with that we now alsoÂ have jobs to help supplement our cost of living here inÂ Mesa Arizona The resort we live at has an annual fee of over $6000. aÂ yearÂ that is increased every year. This collapse will effect the whole world with many people loosing their jobs andÂ way of livingÂ many will blame the USA for the problem and those Ex pats could find themselves on the receiving end of a lot of hate and violenceÂ . I fear what is to come this is not going to go away in a month or soÂ Â Â maybe not for years and those who are ex pats could be in for a very bad time. I encourage you to follow the above web sites for several months not just a day or twoÂ Â Â Get a broad pictureÂ of what is being forecasted .Â  I hope and pray that thisÂ will not come to pass but the evidence says differently.Â Â  I know that you are very busy andÂ may not have a chance to replyÂ if so I will understand. May GOD BlessÂ Â  Â Robert Ketchen US ARMY Retired. Mesa Arizona.Â ",2017-03-26,,

92743,309,Rose-Lee Hatchard ,rositasinvernadero@gmail.com ,,,Canada,"My husband and I and another couple would like to go to the Azuero Peninsula around Dec 28 2017 for approximately 2 weeks to check out areas to rent if we moved there.  I have read lots about renting before you buy so that is why we would like to see different places.

Is there any one place that is more central for us to rent as we would like to make day trips and return at night.  I have yet to look into rental places if you have any suggestion for such a short stay.  At the moment we are all still working but retirement is very near so need to get busy heckling things out.  I also have no idea which visa to apply for!

Also is there a problem with getting a rental car where we are from Canada and do you have any suggestions of rental companies? 

Thank you for your time.   Rose-Lee ",2017-03-26,,

I'm all All Access Member as well as a member of your Global Property Advisor.  Although my wife & I have not been able to attend any conferences I have paid attention to the handouts & videos and we have invested some of our retirement funds in various opportunities that have been presented at the conferences following your diversification recommendations.
I'm interested in how closely you've been following the French Chateau project first presented in December 2013.  Since it's still listed in Global Property Advisor Portfolio Recommendations I'm interested what you're hearing from the developer.
My wife & I invested in March 2014 and our fractional unit was supposed to be completed January 1 this year.    In December I contacted the company to ask for pictures of the completed unit and was told it was not complete - in fact it could be another 12 months before it is completed.  We had received no warning.  
We had inserted a clause in our contract that we would receive back all monies paid if the unit was not completed by January 1st.  Alternatively we could choose to receive an interest payment for each month the unit was not completed.    We chose the refund.   Since we cancelled the contract we have received an interest payment for both January and February but nothing else.  I've been told by staff at the company that sales have been slow and so there's no money to repay us.   Robin Barrasford called me on February 27th to explain that we would be paid our refund but he had to talk to his accountants the nest day before he could give me a timeframe.  Since then I've heard nothing from him and he has not responded to my emails.
My next step is to try to sue for breach of contract (or whatever this will be in the UK legal system) to get our money back.  Since we live in the US I have to try & find a solicitor in the UK who can help us - know anyone?
The reason I'm interested whether you've heard anything from the developer is to find out what you're being told about the project.
Your decision of course but based on what's happened (or not happened) in the last couple of months I'd suggest you might want to at least re-evaluate your risk rating on this project.   It should be a lot higher than 5.  You may also want to contact the developer to see whether you even recommend this investment any more.
I'm interested to hear any information you find out or just the name of a good solicitor :-)
Thanks

I know Lief uses a corporation I think in Europe to hold property is that necessary or is it possible to buy a property in the name of our trust - I have read in your French guide that they are finally getter better on inheritance and wondered if owning in the name of the trust would make it easier as a human doesn't own the property and the kids will take over.  Any other suggestions for us would greatly be appreciated - one other area I am concerned is - if we search for houses in English will the price be higher than if we search in French?  I have found many Immobiliers that specialize in English.  Thanks Kaylee  ,2017-03-27,,
92762,94,Greg,guidrygreg@gmail.com,,,USA,reading your article on why not to have a Panama Corporation to hold real estate.  A question arose.  If a non-income producing property is held in a Panama corporation if you just let the entity go away who retains ownership of the property? Does it go to the government or does the owner of the corporation continue to own the property?  I suspect many like myself have purchased property in Panama years ago and have it in a Panama corporation and pay their attorney for filings every year.,2017-03-27,,

I am told that he can continue to work in his profession and prosper this way as he currently is in his country. 
I understand that for myself I can continue my work in Panama as I do now because my coaching  business is online through internet so I can continue to prosper this way. Unfortunately I cannot have this in Cuba because their internet is not good service however I am told in Panama internet is strong and stable for businesses. Naturally I would get involved to help people in Panama. 
The question before taking this any futher is this: I as a canadian citizen can go and live in Panama and don't require a visa and was informed of the friendly nation visa and have citizenship. Can he as a cuban citizen live in Panama or have the visa or citizenship. We both have very good track record with work health and law so I don't see why we could not live in Panama. I also understand that Panama and Cuba are countries that are friends. Thanks for your guidance as to what is possible. Yvonne

I have a Uruguay manual you did a few years ago it was well put together and informative. You spoke very highly of living in Montevideo and purchased in the Centro neighbourhood. Are you still invested there and what are your general thoughts on Uruguay as a real estate investment destination? Living costs still appear to be quite reasonable given the country's economic stability and quality of life. You've written about Brazilian opportunities what about less discovered parts of the Uruguayan coast around Rocha and closer to the Brazilian border?

92838,94,Ian MacDonell,immacdonell@yahoo.ca,,,Canada,I enjoyed your latest column. Not to pick on Americans [I am currently planning another trip there to see the total eclipse in August and to do some shopping] but I do think they should get out more. Apples to apples- when I was in Argentina in the 70's I met an American couple who complained that their American owned hotel charged them over $20 each for a pork chop dinner. At the same time I was going to local restaurants in Buenos Aires and enjoying a huge steak dinner and half a bottle of wine for less than $2. Safety- I have never felt unsafe in Paris even when the last time security discovered and cordoned off unattended baggage in the airport [benign as it turned out]. I remember an American tourist in Mexico City asking me in wonder if I did not feel unsafe walking about at night. This from someone from a country with a truly amazing level of gun violence.

What is your current feelings toward the Mexican real estate market?  Prices appear to be dropping in some markets (I'm currently in Mazatlan).  Is it the Cartel violence that has notably increased that has frightened the potential buyers?  And in your opinion is this possibly one of those opportune moments to go where others fear and score a great deal?  Any regrets on your recent purchase?

My problem last year I obtained a bill of 78 USD for Live and Invest Overseas however I never received the service. This year I was charged for 2 years service (2016+17) for 158 USD ( 2x79 USD) .

Dear Kathleen and Lief

Thanks for your info on Organic Mango.  Please advise me us on:
1. Time between  planting mango and
    first real harvest?

2. What reliable water sources during
    the whole year do you had and    
    have/ will have the coming years?

3. What is your investment plan and
     Return for 2017 -  2020?

Thanks for your help.
Greetings from Bea and Bill.

BE BLESSED.

My wife and I are considering spending around 6-9 months overseas in our pending retirement and wondering what kind of solutions exist for health insurance in this type of circumstance primarily in the US ?  With the help of your website and hours of research on the internet it seems very possible to have reasonably inexpensive private insurance in many of the western european countries but the US is another story.  What are your suggestions for insurance in the US during that 6 month stay (or less) ?  BTW looking forward to seeing the conference details in August trying to attend to see these kinds of circumstances in person

Thank you for your time and GREAT website loaded with tons of helpful information !

We need to decide where to go to retire.  I am a shooting sports enthusiast so there seemed to be only 3 choices.  Further research has raised red flags for all 3.  Panama sounds like it is getting expensive and the public golfing opportunities look sparse.  Portugal has lots of golf but the economy is in the tank and there's currency risk and it seems even more expensive than Panama.  Ecuador looks affordable but seems to lack infrastructure and sounds very Marxist politically.
Your thoughts?

One of our new friends from Arizona was feeling puny on a Sunday morning and decided to see a doctor. Of course all local doctor offices were closed so he went to a local urgent care facility.  They checked him out from stem to stern and ruled out flu or bronchitis but issued a prescription.  Their office visit bill came to USD $3.50 - not a co-pay just the sticker price! The MD had a his sheepskin from a US medical school on the wall and spoke English.  Our friend's wife set out with a fist full of pesos to fill the prescription and came back with most of the cash. The local pharmacist had her lay out all of their over-the-counter meds they had brought with them on the trip and aligned them with the meds newly-prescribed to ensure that no new reactions would be encountered.  She had never had that service done by a pharmacist in the US!  Kathleen: Your description of offshore medical care is too modest:-))

It was nice meeting you at the Global Property Summit.  I am in need of advice on using my 401K money for some property investments.  I read your article on Solo 401Ks and Self-directed IRAs.  It seems to me that it might boil down to titling the property and maybe how to exit the property with a distribution.  I'm wondering if I might need different entities depending on the property.

Let me give you some background and where I want to go with this.  I am 57 1/2 and have a mandatory retirement age of 65. At retirement I will have approximately 160K per year in pensions.  I currently have an employer sponsored 401K with 650K in it.  This is the money I want to get out of the US and working for me.  I have previously rolled over most of my traditional IRA into a Nuview self-directed IRA.  I used this money to invest in a coffee farm in Panama (ICFP) and a share of a farm in Colombia (Farmfolio).  In addition I have invested individual money in ICFP Simply Natural Avocado and Teak with ECI. 

The first investment I would like to do is a condo at Casa Bonita in Panama for $329000.  The purpose for this would be for investment income until retirement and then to use it for both personal use a few months of the year and income the rest.  I really don't know how to exit this property other than maybe sell it to my daughter (my only heir) or something else  (suggestions requested).  The other thing I'm not sure about is how to handle expenses such as HOAs taxes on rental income etc.  I'm assuming I fund this out of the same account I buy the property with. 

The other investments I'm considering are some you recommended and purely for investment.  Central Suite Towers in the DR at 96K + 10K closing and furniture.  Reserva da Praia and Porto das Dunas in Brazil at 49K and 79K.  And maybe another hectare of Avocados at 45K.  

Can any of these be titled with a Solo 401K?  Would it be better to use the Nuview IRA and form an LLC or a combination of both?  I have your reference for forming a Solo 401K.  Do you have one for forming a US LLC for use with Nuview?

All advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

I loooove this website. Very informative. I am 42 and looking to retire overseas with my wife. We have two younger girls ages now 10 and 6. If I work until I'm 67 my SS income is $1773 but if I wait until I am 70 it will be $2200. Where can retirees get the best bang for their buck.  Is it best to lock in a long term rental now until retirement? Loved medellin col cuenca equador and baja california mexico. Thanks.",2017-04-06,,

From Lief comments It seems that Panama is expense and maybe not the best. I however want to live in Panama. I am thinking to get the friendly country visa. Can you recommend an attorney to do our immigration paperwork for our family of 3? And which country do you recommend for my family trust and holding company. Would a Panama attorney be good to set up these companies? Thanks,2017-04-06,,

I decided to make that my vacation stop to check things out by myself as you made it sound sooo exciting.  I am sure glad I did!!  Why you ask?   Because I now realize that I would never retire there.  Panama City:  too big too noisy and dirty....and crazy drivers..to say the least.  Very few English speaking people.  David:  way too hot and humid..was 93 when I was there.  Bouquette has lots of broken down sidewalks that retirees could break their ankles/legs and very little entertainment for singles.  The ocean.. Too much black sand too difficult to communicate unless you speak Spanish too hOt and too many undercurrents to swim in it.  Don't recommend to Canadians as we could not handle this place.  Probably not a good place for many older Americans either!!  Contrary to your newsletter I would never recommend anybody who is used to 1st world comforts ever move there ...it would be too strange an adjustment.   I had bad luck on this vacation and I have travelled to many parts of the world but this was the worst.

I have Brazilian farmland in ira and roth (am in process of converting all to roth within 3 more years at max) but am looking for a more personalized service.  Where I could ""easily"" get advice on foreign purchases of RE and stock accounts or currency holdings etc.  Equity TC is difficult to deal with to find an ""expert"" or someone who knows what will keep me in line w/ the IRS.   The idea of a ""checkbook"" IRA is great for me and my investment style BUT I know that I can blow the whole IRA account if I make a wrong move.  This is where ETC is not easy to deal with.

I purchased a small lot in Belize last year using my IRA. I was advised to place the funds with a custodian and then create an IRA Single Owner/Member LLC and have the LLC make the purchase. All seemed to go well until I filed the Form 1065 with the IRS reflecting the sole-member of the LLC being the ""Custodian FBO Me"". The IRS accepted the 1065 filing but informed me (due to single-member)that I should have included it with my 1040 under Schedule C E etc. but I do not own the LLC my IRA through the custodian owns it (although I am the manager). Any advice for when I file the 2017 return??",2017-04-08,,

I purchased the Overseas Living Letter subscription early last month for $17 and have not yet received confirmation of the purchase the first issue or any of the other items in the subscription package.
My credit card was charged $17 on March 4.
I have replied to the offer's email and called your customer support number 888-627-8834 to no avail. 
The email was returned with unclear instructions and the customer support phone number is not working neither picking up or taking messages. 

What gives?

I have money in a US brokerage account that I would like to move out of the U.S. but I hesitate to trust it to any Belizean bank. (I have had funds wired to accounts of people I do not know by Caye Bank.  I have been trying for 1 year to get a Belizean LLC account at Atlantic without success.  They insisted on doing due diligence of Midland. What other locations and banks do you recommend for someone not resident there?,2017-04-10,,offshore-site-contact-form

93537,356,Kathy Gubar,kgubar@gmail.com,919-422-0286,,,Hi Lief  I attended the GPS in Panama City and did the Simply Natural farm tour.  As a result I am arranging to buy two hectares.  But after reading your Offshore Living Letter of 4/10 I have some questions.  I am setting up the farmland in my Roth IRA in a US bank so I assume any distributions will be tax free in the future.  But do I have to report the Form 8938 since I will have a bank account for checkbook control.  And what about the threshold?  I am a single still living in the US so does that mean since the two hectares will be over $50K I need to submit this form??  I agree with the obfuscation of paperwork is mind-boggling!!

I purchased in 2015 and received two payments and have not received another. When I notified them they first said they would check with their accounting department.  Ultimately they said that they had little income due to Brexit and delays related to Wyndham and they did not know when payments would start.  Do you have any inside information or advice? Do I just need to be patient? Thank you.,2017-04-11,,offshore-site-contact-form

93964,156,Tony,tullot@yahoo.com,,,USA,"Dear Matt
I would retire to Canada in a minute but what was not addressed in your article espousing the merits of such is that Canada does not want American retirees and does not offer a residency permit to allow living there year around. Just a minor detail I suppose. I would be very happy if you proved me wrong.

94110,156,GC,pace-bene@sbcglobal.net,,,Re: Maritime Canada,"Your mention of options for retirement in the Maritime Province area of Canada sounds interesting but can Americans retire there full-time?  Unless you are able to make a huge investment in Canada or you are still working in a profession of interest to the Canadian economy you don't qualify for a visa that would allow you to live there year-round (at least according to their immigration website).  Is a full-time resident visa possible for American retirees who purchase real estate there?

94655,356,Trevor N,t.neuman@gmx.net,,,,"Hi Lief

As a long-time subscriber I have been following you and Kathleen pretty much right from the start of LIOS actually Kathleen even before that from her time with IL.

Even though you and Kathleen have raised your children overseas you had initially focused on a target market aimed more at retirees.  I am pleased that you have started to address those of us with children as well.

One thing I haven't seen you cover much is sports for kids and teens.

My daughter is 10 and she currently plays soccer (year-round) at a fairly high level playing against boys teams and girls several years older than she is.

I would have thought that with how popular soccer is in most Latin American countries one could find lots of opportunities for girls soccer development.  However so far I have found virtually no information where girls soccer programs are offered.

Do you know any places in Central or South America or the Dominican Republic where there are very strong soccer (football) programs specifically for girls?  I've lived in Mexico for a number of years and I don't believe that having her play against boys would go over very well in such ""macho"" societies...

Any helpful comments that you or Lee Harrison could offer would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks

The people not so much. Armed guards with sawed off shotguns on virtually every corner. You can't take your phone out or it will be snatched from your hands! Sure enough we were robbed by two dirtbags on a motorcycle while crossing the road. A clean cut and snatch so thank God my wife was not hurt. Real pros. So then I dealt with the police. Soooo much fun. as someone called them La policia des infantino! You have to actually pay (bribe) them to make a report. Oh and they are more corrupt than the thieves.
I love the DR but they are a long long way off yet to becoming a retirement option. This is not Sin Maarten or Turks and Caicos. This is the wild wild west with more guns than I have seen (I have a second home near Miami so I have seen a lot of guns!). I think you are doing your readers a disservice promoting the DR.

I always hear how easy it is to get citizenship in the EU when you have a parent from there.  But after contacting the migration office in Sweden they told me if my mom didn't register me as a Swedish citizen before the age of 22 I am not Swedish.

I appreciate the information that your website has provided for my concerns regarding opening a business in Panama. I am currently Canadian and considering moving to Panama to pay less in taxes. I understand that my corporate internet income is 0% but what about personal income when I pay myself from that company? Of course the source of the money is all from outside of Panama but if I am a resident of Panama (which is necessary to not pay taxes to Canada - I believe I have to become a non-resident of Canada) will that mean I pay 0% personal income tax or will I have to pay some regardless of where the money came from?

Thank you very much for your time.",2017-04-17,,

You may remember me (Gary Roth â€“ my wife is Czashka)â€¦.we last saw each other on a plane from Panama to the U.S. We live in Panama Â½ the year in Punta Barco. I know you were living in Panama City but I believe you have or are about to relocate elsewhere (is it to France?). 
I saw your Offshore Living Letter today and I was wondering if you could help direct me to the best person I can go to for some tax and structuring advice on how best to structure/incorporate a new business from an international tax perspective.  I would very much appreciate a recommendation you can give me on this. 
As background to evaluate what weâ€™re looking for very briefly our operation is international-based although we do have some employees in the U.S. China and most likely soon in Ireland. Itâ€™s a business done on the internet in the field of educational testing tutoring and related service. The revenues generated will be subscription-type done online and our subscription clients will first be in China but we are working on rolling this out in Central & South America India Middle East and Europe. The costs are mainly from independent contractors (development of the software platform and accredited teachers in the U.S. grading test questions). We have some employees now in both China and the U.S. who are mainly either working on marketing (to generate client-based revenues and some in the U.S. supervising the training and ongoing work product of the U.S. accredited teachers (teachers are independent contractors as well).
We have a Delaware LLC formed and some affiliated entities in China Ireland and Hong Kong. We are looking for some very good tax advice on how to best structure it all to minimize total taxes globally.
Can you recommend who might be the best suited person/firm to give us advice on this? If you need some more information to evaluate the answer please let me know. 
Thanks very much! Hope all is well with you both. 
Best regards

When I just wrote you asking for a referral you would most recommend for some international tax advice I forgot to ask you if youâ€™d recommend someone in Ireland too for two different situations.  
We most likely will be engaging someone in Ireland for software development (coding platform development) as well as legal & tax advice for Ireland specifically concerning both intellectual property rights (an IP company) and business and tax incentives for IP development in Ireland. 
Can you recommend someone who might help us on the legal and tax side in dealing with IP set up in Ireland? Ideally this also might be someone who would be willing to be a director of our companies since weâ€™ve determined that the Irish companies must have at least one director on the board from within the EU. 
Also have you had any experience with using either a company or a small group of individuals operating as a cohesive team that we could talk to and engage for software and platform development? We have a need to continue our software development beyond what we currently have and weâ€™d like to seriously look at using an Irish team or group for this (as we understand they can be high-quality cost-effective and there are both business and tax incentives within Ireland to do so). Have you had any experience yourselves in utilizing these type of services in Ireland? 
Again thanks very much for any help you can give us on this.
Best regards

95208,356,Gary Roth,grothnyc@aol.com,19178812649,,,"Hi Lief I sent the following through the Offshore Living Letter portal as well. But if this reaches you first I'd really appreciate your recommendation on this. Thank you very much. Hope all is well...

Hi Lief and Kathleen 
You may remember me (Gary Roth â€“ my wife is Czashka)â€¦.we last saw each other on a plane from Panama to the U.S. We live in Panama Â½ the year in Punta Barco. I know you were living in Panama City but I believe you have or are about to relocate elsewhere (is it to France?). 
I saw your Offshore Living Letter today and I was wondering if you could help direct me to the best person I can go to for some tax and structuring advice on how best to structure/incorporate a new business from an international tax perspective.  I would very much appreciate a recommendation you can give me on this. 
As background to evaluate what weâ€™re looking for very briefly our operation is international-based although we do have some employees in the U.S. China and most likely soon in Ireland. Itâ€™s a business done on the internet in the field of educational testing tutoring and related service. The revenues generated will be subscription-type done online and our subscription clients will first be in China but we are working on rolling this out in Central & South America India Middle East and Europe. The costs are mainly from independent contractors (development of the software platform and accredited teachers in the U.S. grading test questions). We have some employees now in both China and the U.S. who are mainly either working on marketing (to generate client-based revenues and some in the U.S. supervising the training and ongoing work product of the U.S. accredited teachers (teachers are independent contractors as well).
We have a Delaware LLC formed and some affiliated entities in China Ireland and Hong Kong. We are looking for some very good tax advice on how to best structure it all to minimize total taxes globally.
Can you recommend who might be the best suited person/firm to give us advice on this? If you need some more information to evaluate the answer please let me know. 
Could you also recommend someone in Ireland too for two different situations.  
We most likely will be engaging someone in Ireland for software development (coding platform development) as well as legal & tax advice for Ireland specifically concerning both intellectual property rights (an IP company) and business and tax incentives for IP development in Ireland. 
Can you recommend someone who might help us on the legal and tax side in dealing with IP set up in Ireland? Ideally this also might be someone who would be willing to be a director of our companies since weâ€™ve determined that the Irish companies must have at least one director on the board from within the EU. 
Also have you had any experience with using either a company or a small group of individuals operating as a cohesive team that we could talk to and engage for software and platform development? We have a need to continue our software development beyond what we currently have and weâ€™d like to seriously look at using an Irish team or group for this (as we understand they can be high-quality cost-effective and there are both business and tax incentives within Ireland to do so). Have you had any experience yourselves in utilizing these type of services in Ireland? 

Thanks very much! Hope all is well with you both. 
Best regards 
Gary

My wife and I are thinking about taking an expeditionary trip to Panama to see where we might want to live for an early retirement in the next few years. We would like to visit an expat haven or two in the highlands. We would also like to mix in a couple of beach towns to make the trip more enjoyable. We would be flying in from Houston and probably renting a car. Any suggestions on where to fly in to and what cities to scout? Any suggestions on where to stay? We would prefer something nice and not too rustic. Maybe three and a half to four and a half starts.

Se have stayed in apart hotels in or close to city centers eaten in local restaurants and tried to do some things that locals might do such as grocery shopping and taking advantage of local entertainment including stuff not in any guidebooks or publicized in articles.  We like the apart hotel idea because everything in included and should we plan to spend more time e.g. a month 3 months 6 months or longer we feel that might be easier and safer than taking out an apartment and setting up utility accounts etc.  We like the idea of people at the desk 24/7 and being near city center where restaurants grocery stores and other stuff are handy.  We would not want to have to maintain a vehicle and like the idea of taxi and public transportation available.  Two notable apart hotels we have used several times include:  Torre de Alba in Panama City (1 br 1 bath living room full breakfast included daily maid service and linen exchange and there is a full washer and dryer in the kitchen as well.  We have stayed at that apart hotel several times.
     We have also stayed in Recoleta/Buenos Aires at an aparthotel called Trianon Residence which offers two bedrooms 2 baths daily breakfast and lots of space and walking distance to lots of places.
   We are a couple in our early 70s so would not want to buy or be in an apartment building without services should be want (or need) to relocate outside of the United States which seems to be headed for difficult times.
I was wondering if you might do an article suggesting the advantages of aparthotel living in various countries that would be geared to people in our like situation older than 65 not interested in setting up utilities wishing for security of knowing there is 24/7 desk available taxi and public transportation hospitals near and on and on.  I'll be there is a growing group of people in this category who would be interested in your comments and plan geared to them.  Like to see a well researched list with a few details.
   Thanks for your consideration and we look forward to your and Kathleen's articles and insights on these many topics.

95272,156,ASHOK SHARMA,ashok_1956@yahoo.com,,,Canada,"Hi Lee
I am considering investing in the mango farms in panama from Simply Natural for my retirement income as I am 62 Years old. Besides the currency risks as I am living in Canada there will be additional risk of Simply Natural going insolvent in the future and my title in the farmland not having much intrinsic value to provide any security. Your views on these will be appreciated. 
However I would also like your opinion whether I should invest in my personal name jointly with my wife and only daughter to avoid probate and inheritance problems if something happens to me or should I open a offshore LLC and invest in its name. I believe opening and operating a LLC has substantial costs. Is there any tax or probate advantages that would justify the additional costs of a LLC.",2017-04-22,,

We are originally Swiss but since we are traveling around over three years by now we are more cosmopolitans who are looking for a new residency. 
We read your reports and think that you might could help us. We love Hawaii and Australia the most but we were told that it is nearly impossible to get residency in Hawaii or Australia (western Australia)  due to our age (52&46).
We would like to invest in a property and get a permanent visa. We have been in Panama Thailand Costa Rica... but we are looking for a warm climate with wind and waves (not too humid) We love to Windsurf Kite and do all kind of outdoor sports. 
What possibilities do we have? Can you help us? 
We have a fixed monthly income. Don't have to work but would love to if there is a possibility. We would love to live on the ocean.... We hope you can assist us and are looking forward hearing from you.

95418,309,Marlies,marliesb80t@gmail.com,,,Canada," other beautiful places Liveandinvestoverseas promotes it is hard to choose.My 4th visit to Panama shocked me. It was unbelievably hot. Prices at Supermarkets are in US$ therefore 30% higher than in Canada even for local products like Bananas Coconut eggs. Half a small Papaya was 90 cents. If you have a market nearby (5 de Mayo) that would be cheaper but going there by taxi and back negates the savings. Local Bus and Metro travel good. Long haul Bus Travel Panama City to David is inexpensive at  $15 US 10 to 12 hours.Highway under construction. Beware of air conditioning being freezing. Day Bus excellent Mercedes double decker Passport or ID check before David. Night Bus to Bocas de Toro not recommended. Arrival in Almirante at 4 am wait about an hour or more for first boat to take you too Isla Colon Bocas de Toro another wait for boat to Bastimentos. Boat is included in price of Bus ticket however not Boat to Bastimentos. Price $3.00 1 person with luggage don't pay more.  Dwellings on Shore have no sewage treatment. everything goes directly into the Caribbean and I chose not to swim. At the end of the dry season (April) Hostal Casa Bubba had water 1 hour am and 1 hour pm as filtered rain water.. Tourists use 10 times more water than locals. Food at Casa Bubba was ok and affordable staff and volunteers very friendly. 10 pm light out on terrace 11 pm quiet except for Monday night band playing past midnight and visitor congregating on terrace all night as there is nobody on duty.
Boquete is what it is a dilapidated town surrounded by expensive Ex PAT properties that pay no property taxes for 20 years. How is a town supposed to pay for civic improvement that would benefit everybody? Why are two ""good"" Hotels for sale?  One new building under construction one decent plaza building with Bank Remax Real Estate office some nice coffees with terrasses at 5th street. Nobody uses addresses by street. They indicate next to the plaza or next to the gas station etc. On main Street some nice restaurants with good food a nice plaza near the market and Mamallena Hostal  over the bridge beautiful gardens left over from the Flower Festival the artisan market is once  a month I think locals as well as Ex Pat sell Food home made breads and pastries organic vegetables jewellry clothing and souvenirs. Under the bridge on the river is a quiet little coffe pastryshop
I have to use a cane to walk the sidewalks are not in good condition and  are narrow but I appreciated the shaved off curbs and sidewalks and pedestrian crossing which where honored by most cars. Best of all was the coffee and visit lectures and tasting of specialty coffee at International Coffee Farms.
The surrounding area offers a variety of excursions very suitable for backpackers the hike to Vulcan Baru is a challenge even for them.
It is only recently that an ambulance is servicing Boquete however there is no hospital something to consider in retirement.
Before I left Panama I had occasion to visit Simply Natural Mango Farm. That was the most beautiful country side the Codillera Mountains in the background Parkland surrounding the farmland rows upon rows of young trees the river flowing through it the well appointed greenhouses the friendly faces and smiles of the workers. It was quite an uplifting visit. 
My visit to Panama was an eye opener. I departed on April 12 and the rainy season started. 
Will I visit Panama again? I  might consider only for shorter stays rental is quite affordable. There is also an oversupply of Hotel rooms and Condo rental.With so many beautiful and affordable places promoted by  liveandinvestoverseas we have a fantastic choice.",2017-04-25,,

 After two visits to Medellin  (the first a two week stay and attendance at a Live and Invest Conference the second a one month stay to further explore as I neared my retirement date) I sold my home in Seattle WA in June 2016 and moved to Medellin in September 2016.  LOVE IT!

 Here is my problem: US Taxes. I am  not trying to avoid or do anything other than the right thing. I do not have a US accountant as I have always used Turbo Tax.  With the sale of the house I feel a need to have a professional prepare my taxes this year.

 Please recommend a trusted English-speaking accountant in Medellin for my US federal tax preparation. (state tax not needed -- Washington State does not have state income tax).

I really enjoy reading the LIOS daily posts and have been to several conferences.  I have a question and I hope you can help.
I am nearing time to retire.  I live in a beautiful city in Florida which i enjoy for about five months of the year but I suffer through summers with heat and humidity.  
I have looked at several cities with ""eternal spring"" weather places like San Miguel d'Allende Medellin and Cuenca and those mountain cities were where I was most interested for retirement.  However I have recently been diagnosed with a chronic respiratory disorder that would be exacerbated by living in high altitude.  My cardiologist strongly advises against living somewhere in high altitude.
Do you have suggestions for ""eternal spring"" cities without excessive heat or humidity and which are also at sea level?

To my understanding the â‚¬280000 â‚¬350000 (both rehabilitation areas) and â‚¬500000 (any area) all allow for residency permit with possibility of citizenship in six years as long as the guidelines are followed. Is my understanding correct?

Are there companies that exclusively deal with the â‚¬280000-350000 range for investment that you would recommend?

Should any of the currently proposed SHFT scenarios occur the potential  lack of access to financial funds etc. may cause our new country to find us less than desirable. How well do you think we would be treated without adequate funding especially if that country was hit hard as well? Being isolated from loved ones unwelcome yet unable to remedy the situation seems like a nightmare rather than the idyllic dream of current life as an expat. I suppose the true query at hand is this: should a major SHTF event occur woukd we be in general better off here or as an expat? Knowing you are no seer I still am interested in your thoughts on this topic.

After reading today's (5/1) Offshore Living Letter I felt the need to write you for any wisdom you might be able to pass along.

A few years ago I paid Chris Reeves/Chris Rusch (Premier Offshore Investor) to form a Belize LLC owned by Midland IRA (Chicago) and me as sole manager.  Opening a Caye Bank Belize account was also part of the arrangement.  I have not had any issues to date.  However I have never been invoiced by anyone/any entity for any annual or other LLC maintenance fees since this thing was opened.  Should I be concerned?  Should I be looking for another Trusted Agent?  If so how would I proceed?  Could you make a recommendation?  

Thanks for your time.

Sincerely

These sites practice selective information. If it makes you want to go that's in there. if it's negative  its intentionally left out. need proof? Check Portugal you will see a heading for tax situation COLOMBIA has no such heading Why? because the subject is positive in Portugal and a deal breaker on Colombia. 
     Stay there more than six months and you are considered a tax resident and all your world wide income is taxed there and again in the US.  That's not the worst of it you are also subject to an asset tax of 3% on all your world wide assets . IRAs are not excluded in either the income and asset taxes as they are not exempt as they are in the US. If you think they won't know what you have guess again your own government happily provides the information to any foreign government who asks . And they do ask!

95650,376,Rob Schechtman,sheckdog@yahoo.com,,,USA,"Hi Steve
I just read your article titled ""Never Make Another Mortgage Payment"".  It wasn't quite clear in the article if this strategy is only good for people of a certain age with a certain term left on their mortgage etc.
My situation is a bit unique as I'm attempting to at least ""semi"" retire at quite a young age and mostly due to equity in my home due a perfect purchase at exactly the right time.
I am turning 47 in two weeks.  I have a 30 year fixed loan at 3.5% which I am 4 years into with $372k outstanding.  My home value is over $1M.
My 'retirement' plan at this point is based on renting out my entire home at a cash flow positive rate and then using that cash flow to fund my travels around the World.  Clearly not having to cover the monthly costs associated with my mortgage would better allow me to accomplish this.

Please advise if you think your strategy could work for me and if so best next steps to investigate it's feasibility.

Thank you

95708,94,DIETER WILHELM,dfwil@sympatico.ca,,,CANADA,"Hi Kathleen since  about my retirement in2002 I was dreaming of a warmer winter place than Canada or Germany. You see I'm Canadian and European. But I dreamed of Belize until I had two strokes  in  2015 and 16 and that changed my life. I needed a Hospital with a cardiology department not to far away.
 I still had dreams but your letter about Belize opened my eyes and made me realize that Belize is not for me. I have a 75ha former farm property in Canada 250km north of Toronto but live in a small town with a Hospital nearby. It is 5 month of the year useless to cold. Wolves and Coyotes have been sighted so Sheep farmers are out.
I spend 2 years in Sudan/Khartoum as Broadcast engineer for a development project. The weather was fantastic the Blue Nile water only sand filtered was the best I ever tasted. To bad the Islamic fanatics ruined the country. It could be on your list too.
Now I have my eyes on south Portugal or Azores. You never mentioned the Azores. Do you have anything on them? 
I have a Cottage in Germany but need something warmer  for Winter. Thanks for all the informative Letters keep them coming 
Greetings from a to cold Canada +5 on the 3.of May

1- selling a current US based business huge taxes will be paid which Im very upset about so....  so next business I would like to incorporate in Panama since its a active web based business and sales will be from many parts of the USA and abroad.   Do I understand correctly that if I file as a Panama corp set up a Panama bank account that up to $100k earned income on a active business will be 100% tax free in Panama and since its a Panama corp no USA taxes at all?  

what is the other income earned taxed at  if profits are higher? 

and the USA has no involvement?

is this the best starting strategy? eventually maybe apply for a second passport in Panama

also cash in a savings account in Panama earning interest also 100% tax free? 

I would keep my US bank account as well along with another bank account where I currently stay but remaining would go into a panama bank  is Panama currency safe?

This is all very new and I have done research online but you seem to be very versed and I need come ""consulting "" on this.

Thanks for the newsletter enjoying it and learning alot

I do not do any international investing because of many reasons and here are some:

1) unfavorable tax structures with the US both from the point of view of the foreign countries and from the US regarding foreign income or capital gains 

2) unfavorable lending rules and guidelines to leverage the investments 

3) unfavorable laws in foreign countries regarding rights of ownership 

4) difficult and inflexible international banking systems that would make it very hard to transact as US residents or Citizens (with FBAR and FATCA etc) 

5) hard to reach on a moment notice like anywhere within the US 

6) currency exchange risk of devaluation

I can go on and on but suffice it to say Puerto Rico is as far as any wise small investor should venture

95805,94,John Trible,jrtrible@gmail.com ,,,United States,"Hi Kathleen
Basically I am interested in having a location overseas that we can get residency and ultimately option for applying for citizenship.  My wife and I are in mid- fifties and probably 5-7years from retirement.  We speak only English but are willing to learn.  We are US citizens.  Looking for a first world sort of experience probably Western Europe.  We have 3 children  (ranging from 14-22) and ideally would like them to have residency too and chance at citizenship.   Portugal has caught my eye though Portuguese might be tough!  Also dealing with government or other  documents in a foreign language  is intimidating given we would no one initially.  Ireland or the UK has also attracted my attention for this reason and though we are hoping to get out of snowy Midwest  probably doable though warm and dry ideal.  Malta citizenship program simply much too expensive for us though would have otherwise possibly considered it.  Could you provide a ""short list"" that would address residency to citizenship option first world ideally  ideally EU and importantly that our kids could gain permanent residency with.  Again warm and dry best but English usage is a nice plus so flexible on that.  
Thank you for any assistance you can provide and would love to do a formal telephone or Skype consultation if possible.
Best Regards

This question probably won't apply to most of your readers but I would greatly appreciate an answer nonetheless. 

I have been through some very hard times since 2010 and used food for comfort. My weight gain was rapid and substantial. I finally turned around my habits and In the past year I've lost over 100 pounds. I still have about 100 to go. 

My question is this. What countries will I be welcome in? I'm sure at first glance I will look like the soul of gluttony even though my eating habits are moderate. I don't want to travel or resettle somewhere I'll be made fun of or looked upon as a freak or a selfish person who eats ""more than my share"".

I read your new post about furnished rentals in MedellÃ­n.  Great news for me as we bought a penthouse in the La Frontera area (one long block from the ciclovÃ­a) just a few months ago.  We chose that area because we will live there approximately 5 months each year so the decision wasn't ""all"" about rental income.  

I just want to point out that I think you should educate your readers or at least reinforce that buying real estate there is NOTHING like it is in the states... there is no MLS and it is perfectly normal (and necessary) to work with more than one agent.  Finding homes in the price ranges you listed is not all that easy necessarily when you're working with agents who will only show you listings from their company.  Ahem FAR cough cough.

I have the same health problems as Mrs Van H. and am in my Seventies. I happen to know Vina del Mar (Chile). Nice place but too far away from both Europe and North America. Same for Punta del Este (Ururguay) where I have been many times and terribly dull during ""dead season"". GijÃ³n (Spain) is a great area but people speak only Spanish. May I recommend an alternative worthwhile to consider ? Canary Islands (Spain) especially the island of Gran Canaria and its gorgeous capital Las Palmas excellent all-year-round climate (25Â°C at Christmas slightly more during Summer with cooler nights dry climate in spite of being surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean). English is one of the leading foreign languages spoken on the islands (with German) people are open-minded welcoming. Excellent clinics and hospital excellent food daily flights to everywhere. I can recommend. It is the hidden secret paradise to many foreigners from all origins and Nations. Low cost of living due to Free-Zone status. Give it a try you will like it. You will find plenty of information on internet. Kind regards Andre Schneider (Switzerland)",2017-05-10,,

You need to take a trip to the coastal area in Ecuador and get the latest information. 
You mentioned that Salinas has flights available to Quito however you failed to mention only one flight on Friday and one flight on Sunday. 
Manta on the other hand has 4 flights per day all week long. Also Manta was given the go ahead for a direct international flight from the States. The immigration office is already planned in the new Airport.
Also there are no beachfront condominiums on the beach in Salinas. They are all across the very loud street that runs 24 hours per day. 
Manta's beachfront condo's runs all the way down the coast directly on the beach and is a much longer beach than Salinas. 
Yes the earthquake was horrible but at the same time Manta has been awarded enough money to make the city new again. many projects improving roads and infrastructure has already begun and many condo's are like new after remodeling with insurance funds. 
Manta is still the fastest growing city in Ecuador and has some of the best restaurants and beautiful buildings on the coast. Definitely should be a stop on your list of coastal cities.

Consider a self directed IRA that is used to purchase residential rental property.  To keep things simple assume one house in the account and the rent EXACTLY equals the payments and other expenses.  As such there is zero cash.

The owner of the IRA reaches 70 and must make an RMD.  Since there is zero cash in the account and the house is not fungible how does he do it?

Iâ€™m forwarding it to you for a response because it shows the same concerns I have as a new real estate syndicator."" Even I could have answered most of his concerns simply from having read your newsletters for years. But Leif's response was as always calm and rational.

Dear Kathleen Peddicord

My wife just turned to be 70 years and I myself are 80.
Both in good health and condition.
 
We are looking to permanently living in Medellin or Santa Martha Colombia.

Please will you be so kind to answer some questions?

1. Please advise the route to get  permanent Visa for Colombia what will be the
cost in total for the Permanent Visa? Do we start in Medellin or Santa Martha?

2. We prefer to start renting a simple apartment outside the towncentre.
What do we have to pay for renting and for monthly living in Medellin and in Santa Martha?

2. What do we pay for in Colombia and for worldwide Health Insurance per month
     or per year per person?

Greetings also to Lief from Bea and Bill.

Thanks for your help.

Bill

BE BLESSED.

96143,376,Don Funsch,ddfuns@yahoo.com,,,USA,Me and my wife both have credit scores around 850. She has retired at 67 and I am going to retire in a couple of years at 70. Hence our income is going to be reduced. We have credit cards with high available  credit that we really do not use but about a 3rd of the available. We pay our bills totally in one month with no roll over and interest payments. We applied for credit a year ago for a purchase that we were making at 0% for a year. The credit card company by accident gave us separate credit card account with $18000.00 credit each.  Since our income is shrinking is it a good idea to cancel one of the cards as our income to available credit is way out wack now? how would this effect our credit rating? At the credit rate we should be debt free in one year if we are good.  Thanx for listening,2017-05-15,,
96144,94,Allen K,allen.kazmerski@gmail.com,,,USA,"Hi Kathleen this is not really a ""mailbag"" comment but  I do have a comment about your remarks on Panama City given in an interview on the Gerry D radio program. You stated that ""you don't recommend Panama City for retirement anymore."" I think that a blanket statement like that may not be accurate. I know that you are targeting the audience with smaller incomes and you recommend retirement areas that will support living with limited income. However you may be missing a whole segment of folks who have more funds available and still sign up to read your recommendations. People who have saved and or have pensions and higher social security benefits and maybe a big wad of money that they can invest. I am sure they are among your readers. My wife and I have been following other sites along with yours for 11 years. We first visited Panama in 2006 and have been going back every year. We have 2 condos rented long term so we know Panama and we know and you know many others that have invested in and retired to Panama City. I would think that many of your readers have the resources to invest in Panama City. Why not have a separate category and separate recommendations for those with higher incomes. Instead of just sheaparding those folks with $2400 in monthly income why not create an income threshold for those with more income. Perhaps it is $3600 or $4800 per month that would qualify you to entertain investing in a tropical boom town. You are also eliminating those retirement folks who only want the trappings of a big city. Sure the traffic is horrendous. However the infrastructure projects especially the new bridge and continued metro expansion and the two way bus lanes on Corredor Sur will somewhat ease the crunch. I'm just saying that you have an entire audience out there that you can target separately from those only looking for a lower cost of living. It's the adventure and the excitement and the hustle and bustle of a great city (yes) that drives many others. Panama City offers that adventure and excitementand is still less expensive that living in the U.S.  Perhaps it's time to get back on the Panama City bandwagon and introduce it to those who can afford it.

Belize is a beautiful country with very friendly and welcoming people. If you expect safety and security stay in the US and build yourself a storm shelter with all the trappings of a luxury house or you could buy a nuclear condo in Kansas that is totally self sufficient for a few million dollars. I have spent almost half a year in Belize in the last 2 years and my parents moved there on the QRP program 3-1/2 years ago. If it was unsafe I would not have recommended Belize to them. I have never been hassled or harassed in Belize and neither have they all the neighbors love my mom and stepdad and we are greeted as friends.

In response to one of your letters about living in a spring like climate I can highly recommend the Rosarito/Ensenada corridor.  I have lived in Rosarito about 16 years and built some Oceanside houses here and the weather is among the best in the world..  Our temperatures range from highs of 77 degrees in the summer to about 67 in the winter.  Our lows in the winter are about 50 degrees at night.  We only get about 10 inches or rain so its really beautiful all year around.  San Diego is just a short ride across the border which is another really nice aspect of living here.  Also living here is a absolute bargin.  I have been to about 40 countries and I can tell you in my opinion we have one of the best if not the best climate in the world.

I love reading your articles particularly the ones about buying properties in Medellin. 

However I don't think you even talked about the severe pollution issue in Medellin (and it's getting worse and worse) as if not even an issue to you.

Have you read this article and the comments - 

http://medellinliving.com/pollution/

How can people live in such a polluted place (despite there are many good things about living in Medellin)? 

Why are you and Live and Invest Overseas keep promoting Medellin a place to retire and invest?

No I am not concerned about crimes etc. in Medellin only pollution. 

Thank you.

I enjoy reading your articles and find a lot of useful information. I have lived in Costa Rica for 23 years and enjoy it. I have an ocean view gated community overlooking Samara Beach that I would like to sell as I'm getting up in years and have some health issues. If you would be interested in helping me sell it a joint venture or buy it at a very reasonable price  we should have a conversation. There is about 80 hectares left with at least 80 lots most of which are ocean view.

I am an enthusiastic readed of your newsletters and enjoy the comments. Recently there was a Canadian wishing to buy a property in Fortalesa Brazil. Bad choice if she likes water sports etc. Did you know that only 20-30% of waste water is treated in Brazil and the balance is dumped into the Ocean as raw untreated sewage. The whole coastline of Brazil is polluted badly therefore I cancelled my vacation this year to this appatrently beautiful country. So sad that there government is virtually doing nothing to remedy this sitution.

      I will be retiring in August of this year and have been thinking seriously about moving overseas. I just read your article about planned communities and am considering this type of lifestyle. The biggest problem for me is finding a community that is ""pet friendly"". I have 3 dogs and 2 cats. Along with finding the right community I must pick a place that has good quality vet care within a 30 minute drive from my home. Although I am open to all possibilities I am leaning towards Belize. 
   Thank you very much for your help!

You can check their website www.mapiamericas.com and see what the maps look like.  Even with all the changes to the roadways over the last few years these maps have been pretty accurate and definitely very helpful.  We still bring our older map (2012?) with us when we visit Panama and it still helps us to get around.,2017-05-19,,

So I took your advise early on about DR and bought a condo in Las Terrenas in 2013 and a 2nd one that came open next to it in 2014.  Now I can use one for investment and one to live in. I can walk to the beach restaurants downtown and shopping. The medical and dental clinic is just a little farther--where I have already had dental work done--and a bridge made!

Back in France in 2013 I've been working as PA like Marion for a Chinese couple in Nice for almost 3 years one of the best experience I had then I got into a Bakery business where I was in charge of sales and in direct relationship with my bosses and their 3 others restaurants also a great experience that lenght a year and a half then i decided to quit in order to start another adventure here in panamÃ  ! 

It's been less than a week that I'm here in Coronado 
I'm willing to find a new position in a team of leaders that will for sure take me to another level as I'll be for sure dedicating my positive energy great interpersonal skills and of course efficiency.

2 - I know the Algarve region is expat heavy (a good thing for me) which city in Spain has the most expats?

United States National Cancer Institute: ""Radiofrequency energy unlike ionizing radiation does not cause DNA damage that can lead to cancer. Its only consistently observed biological effect in humans is tissue heating. In animal studies it has not been found to cause cancer or to enhance the cancer-causing effects of known chemical carcinogens.""

The FTC: ""Scam artists follow the headlines to promote products that play off the news â€“ and prey on concerned people. If you're looking for ways to limit your exposure to the electromagnetic emissions from your cell phone know that according to the FTC there is no scientific proof that so-called shields significantly reduce exposure from these electromagnetic emissions. In fact products that block only the earpiece â€“ or another small portion of the phone â€“ are totally ineffective because the entire phone emits electromagnetic waves. What's more these shields may interfere with the phone's signal cause it to draw even more power to communicate with the base station and possibly emit more radiation.""

96571,94,Nancy Wills,dr_wills@hotmail.com,Uruguay,,,"Kathleen the letter from Mary M. in this past Mondayâ€™s e-letter really touched a nerve with me.  I have to say I agree completely with Mary. 

You are out of line.

Thanks to you now we are out of line too.  And clearly in some very good company.

The things you write about and the people you sometimes feature in your e-letters demonstrated to us that we could turn that whole job paradigm on its ear.  With a little help from the Internet and Skype we enjoy more freedom than we ever imagined.  Instead of being tied to a job for 50 weeks a year and escaping for two weeks of vacation weâ€™ve packed up our jobs and brought them with us.

No longer are we dragging ourselves out of bed at 5:30 in the morning grabbing a cup of coffee and a bowl of cold cereal and staggering off to a miserable commute to jobs that controlled the better part of our days â€“ things are definitely different now.  We wake up early yes but we enjoy a relaxing cup of coffee in bed as we wake up.  After a second cup of coffee and a piece of toast we go out for a walk along the river.  During the week we take a 5-mile walk (about an hour and a half).  On weekends we indulge in an 8-mile walk.  This is our conversation time â€“ anything and everything.  No hurry no interruptions.  All around us are people walking jogging running cycling roller blading skateboarding.  Down by the marina we say buenos dias to the fishermen patiently waiting for their morning catch â€“ or just enjoying the fresh air and sunshine.  Fishing isnâ€™t always about catching fish right?

When we get home itâ€™s maybe 10 a.m. and time to go to work.  So my husband heads to his office and I head to mine â€“ offices that are in the two smaller bedrooms in our riverfront apartment.  No more commuting!  And no coffee breaks half-hour lunch breaks or miserable afternoon commute.  Coffee is ready and waiting whenever we want it.  We can have a lovely hot meal mid-day because thereâ€™s always at least an hour between Skype conferences so we donâ€™t have to rush.  In the evening thanks to MLB.TV we can take in a Cubs game or root for the Red Sox.  And no worries that we â€œhave toâ€ get up early the next morning to start it all over again.

Weâ€™ve been indulging in what Mary M. calls â€œfantasyâ€ for a good ten years now in four countries.  Central America isnâ€™t a â€œhot plateâ€ â€“ although I have to admit Panama is indeed a hot place.  (Iâ€™ve never been to Mexico which is actually part of North America so Iâ€™ll leave its defense to those who know it well.)  Uruguay is delightful and very much like small cities in Europe.  Colombia especially Medellin is a terrific place.  And contrary to some opinions Pablo Escobar is still dead.

In the next twelve months our jobs will accompany us to the Dominican Republic Belize possibly Nicaragua France maybe Englandâ€¦ they are having almost as much fun as we are!

So I agree Kathleen:  You are out of line.  And we are very happy to be out of line.

Because that line that Mary wants you to get back into?  It leads nowhere.

Keep up the great work!

96692,156,Ivan Akinfiev,akinfievivan@gmail.com,,,United Kingdom,"Dear Mr Harrison

I am 18 years old and I have just finished college in the UK. I have been to a few motivational speeches by real estate investors who have shown that it is possible to put money into real estate without actually owning the money - using a system called OPM (Other People's Money)

I have no access to people with lots of unused money but at one of these presentations someone suggested that I open several credit cards/loans (e.g for an investment of Â£25000 - 2x Â£10000 loans and 1x Â£5000 loan) to invest into real estate. The problems lie in that:

- I need to be sure that I will be able to pay back the monthly payment (people will actually rent the property)

- I need to make sure that my monthly return from each investment exceeds the monthly payment so that I have money on the side which I can pay next months payment with if the tenants chose to/are not able to pay this month's rent.

- Ideally I should be able to not just break even but actually sell the property generating me some profit

My question is this:

I've searched for loans using various websites and what I see doesn't quite make sense. They say that the interest rate is 3.2% APR representative (which means 3.2% after everything has been counted) on a 6 year/Â£25000 loan but after 6 years I will end up paying Â£30992.40 which is something like a fifth over what I am borrowing.

I saw a link on your website where for $25000 I could invest in a property in Cartagena Colombia with ""8% returns""... and I assumed that if I had to pay 3.2% monthly I would actually be left with 4.8% every month in profit. It would mean that I would need to pay Â£516.54 a month and the rest would be put away into a savings account. What does APR mean and how often would one get a return on the 8% from the Cartagena investment?

Could you please let me know if it is possible to do what I am trying to do and if yes how I could do it? I come from a disadvantaged background of immigrants and have no money to enter real estate with but would like to invest in something that will definitely bring me income

Thank you
Have a blessed day!

One that can be applied anywhere in the Andes especially on the flanks of volcanoes! The Colombian People could have used this concept this past year as a flood abatement means I do believe. 
I am intending to move to either Ecuador or Columbia and apply my concept (DREAM) as a 66 year old pensioner (I am earning $1100 p/m) vis Social Security and the VA.
The issue is twenty years ago I was given a ""Felony"" conviction here in Oregon. My ""Record"" was clean before and has been clean since my ""Release"" in June of 2006. 
May we discuss this issue and any possible resolves to it? I know help is needed I just do not know where to go or who to talk to?

97029,94,RH Loren,rennloren@gmail.com,Norway-USA,,,"Aloha Kathleen

I first corresponded with you back when Robert Gallo was just beginning his Escape Artist website. Probably around 1997 or so. I had bought and read his Escape from America book. 

I used to contribute a few articles as I was living in Norway and Sweden at the time. I believe that you were contributing stories and newsletters from Ireland. I remember reading something about your experiences with Ireland. 

For the past few years I have been living in Key West Punta Gorda and most recently Lake Charles LA. This has been more a case of following opportunities than by reason of having made a conscious choice. I was originally traveling a Trop Rock music circuit playing the venues and regions that were supporting my music. Then out of nowhere I ended up with a job writing for the most-read printed publication in Lake Charles - Lagniappe Magazine.

As of last week an opportunity has arisen for me to run a radio station in the Dominican Republic town of Sosua.

I would like to know if you have had any experience(s) with or in the DR or if you could suggest the best sources of information about life and conditions there?

I've read a bit and have some friends there but it's always good to get as much info from as wide a variety of sources as possible.

Thanks

I am a disabled US Marine who terribly want to sell my house and move permanently to South America  with Uruguay in mind. T he thing that worries me a lot is all my income is  tax free from the US government in the form of Social Security retirement of $1492.00 and V.A. 100% rated permanent disability of $3068.11 plus the only way for me to buy a house is with my VA loan. I have little to no savings and live without too much If I sell my current home it will get rid if the monthly mortgage payment of $1477.31 but there is no equity in the house as I bought it for my wife and I about a year ago. I am divorced now in Feb. of this year. Lief is there any chance for someone like me to find a quiet and happy life anywhere south of the USA?  My US income makes me afraid to leave but have a strong desire to do so and purchased many reports from your wife  in an attempt to get out of the USA. One last comment; I am in the process now of  renewing my passport which expired last July. Any advice as I tried living in Panama but my wife then had a mainland China passport which made it difficult to bring her to Panama; but as I said I am divorced from her now.

Sincerely

What's more and for a limited time only the developer is offering an additional 20% cash discountâ€”meaning that the starting price comes down to just US$9520.""   So if you can be patient I have the $$$ in my IRA and it will take a few days to get you the $$$.   That is my preferred method so I can keep it in my personal ownership.

97422,156,Kelly Knape,kgiving@yahoo.com,,,Spain,"Dear Lucy
Thank you for all your advice about Spain. I thought I did my research and accepted that there would be income tax in Spain on world-wide income with a deduction for taxes paid in the U.S. What I didn't know was that every year you have to declare your net worth - ""Patrimonio"" - and pay a tax for amounts over about 700000 euros by March 31. For those of us retiring we have amassed a significant amount to allow this. Though pensions are not included many of us have retirement plans with annuities which are not exempt. 

When I have tried to ask about this of other expats online I don't get much of an answer if any. It seems that many are flying under the radar or claiming ignorance. And some of these who have a very obvious online presence describing their life as residents in Spain - some selling books about it with advice deny that they have any tax obligation saying all their income is outside Spain. I can only hope that they are living outside of Spain for more than 183 days per year.

My question is this - is there any evidence of expats being targeted for tax evasion? My husband is paranoid - if we don't file and pay there is a chance that we may lose the opportunity to renew our current 2 year visa - or worse.

Really looking forward to your comments.",2017-06-06,,

We are moving to Torrevieja Spain in September. We have Military and SFPD retirement pays along with Social Security for both of us. The retirements pays are about $3400 per month and somewhat less for Social Security. We are planning t live in Spain for at least a year and possibly longer. What will our tax consequences be? Should we only declare our retirement pays? We are not planning on buying I am 81  my wife 69 and we own RE in California and Texas that is doing well. We do not want to  sell them at this time.  
So what is the answer will we have a big tax hit in Spain or not? Would it be better to ignore the Social Security? All of our funds will be going into US banks.

I have been reading and using your info for years. Thank you so much! Now I am going to be traveling for a while and am not sure where to find the VISA and airport facts I need for these changing times. I've taken a house sitting job outside of Malaga for three months which I know is fine without a VISA. From there I plan to visit Portugal and I'm not sure how long I want to travel but I assume my airplane ticket must reflect my return date to comply with regulations. So do I fly to Spain (maybe Barcelona) and out of Portugal? I don't think a one way ticket is permitted these days without a long stay VISA which I do not have. I just found out today that I need to be in Spain by mid-July. Do you know or can you refer me to someone who can help me figure out what strategy would be most economical? I am on a very limited budget and would love to avoid hectic airports if I can. What do you suggest? Thank you in advance!!",2017-06-07,,

Recently your focus has been Portugal which is very inviting. Weather is my #1 priority and cost of living #2. My retirement income is plenty for either location. I can communicate in Spanish but do not know any Portuguese. Based on what I've said do you have an opinion on the best place? Perhaps somewhere else?

I read your article ""How Much Does It Really Cost To Live In Portugal?"" 
I am currently renting a fully-furnished one bedroom apartment in Porto. It's top of the line in a secured high rise and it has everything in it. I moved in literally with just my bags.
The rent is 800 Euros and its located on Avenida Boavista just a bus ride from the city center and tourist spots. The water/gas/electricity add up to $75 per month and the TV/Cable/Internet comes to $39 euros. The maid service is 5 Euros an hour and the food is really cheap. 
However I would prefer the Algarve. After all Porto is just another city. I will be visiting the Algarve and follow the advice in your article. Lately you have been covering Portugal pretty well.

We are a trio of best friends/investors from South Africa. No wives and kids though.

We are interested in living and working in Panama though buying or investing in property or businesses.

The teak investment program seems to be an easy way in. The idea is to register a company with all three equal ownership. We could alternatively be interested in buying and running a bar/restaurant/B&B in addition to the teak program or as an alternative if the teak investment is not then required. Keep in mind some of us have more capital available than others.

Looking forward to more information from you.

I have other issues with IL but this time I'd like to continue her discussion of the need for expats to make an honest attempt to integrate into the local culture.

That means no gated communities that means that unless you are rich -- and you can then simply live along with those locals who share your prosperity -- you are probably not going to be living on the same level with all the same amenities that you are used to in the States.

Yes I too am addressing Americans specifically. Americans tend to be spoiled some incredibly so. I hate to generalize especially since in the past few years especially many of us have suffered through the economic crisis and more of us than you think have lost everything as a result. But many still expect an American lifestyle upon moving abroad. I wish this weren't so encouraged by IL.

I have lived abroad before and I plan to again. The difference with me is with my single status and lack of funds for any kind of real estate or other investments I can only hope to be living in the same way I did when I was working in Japan and (long ago before it became difficult) Spain: small apartment among local neighbors lots of lively interaction with new friends plenty of delicious food cultural opportunities... you get it. I will be moving to live among locals doing what they do getting to know them.

Of course I tend to favor populated areas so I hope to also meet many fellow expats. But I'd hope that by the time I'm in a position to go many more expats will desire to also assimilate as I will.",2017-06-12,,

97752,356,Kacie Crisp,drkaciecrisp@gmail.com,415 302-0163,,,I'm wondering if we followed your advice too closely. We have about $110000 in our joint Roth which we've invested in a hectare each of limes and mangoes as well as 1/4 share of R Post.  None of these is generating income yet (except for $500 for the first intercropping of mangoes).  We did this through a Belizean LLC & Georgetown which costs us about $750 a year.  Keeping both IRAs self directed at Midland is another $700 a year.  Then there's $175 a year and the aggravation of dealing with the checking account the LLC requires at Caye Bank.  We also have $300 in storage fees for precious metals every quarter.  My husband goes a bit ballistic at all these servicing fees.  We've sold our residence in CA and have a chunk of cash sitting liquid until I figure out where to invest it for a good return.  I'm wondering if we really require all this structure. We have little to no lawsuit exposure in the U.S.  My husband turns 59 -1/2 next month so we could take everything out of the Roth if we wanted to.  I realize then we'd lose the tax exemption and I'm also nervous that our Uncle Sam may see retirement accounts as low hanging fruits and tax/seize them which is an argument to get out of them. What's your take?,2017-06-12,,offshore-site-contact-form

My husband and I have had the pleasure of meeting you at Live and Invest Overseas conferences. Recently you wrote a very informative article on obtaining residency in Mexico. Unfortunately I have misplaced that article and am unsure if you wrote it for LIO or International Living or for the Simon Letter ( all of which we subscribe to ). We are preparing to retire and are interested in obtaining permanent residency in Mexico and believe your thorough discussion of the process would be helpful. We've been to Mazatlan and liked the city but are leaning towards Puerto Vallarta because of the many friends both locals and expats that we have made there. Could you please  direct me to where you published your article ? Thank you  so much in advance. We always look forward to reading your writings.",2017-06-14,,

I have been following you and your wife for about 7 years now.  I am a 60 year old single female with a 38 year old  daughter with a mild orthopedic limitation.  We are on a limited budget however we have a lump sum that we could invest in a home with a  secure and welcoming community overseas or in a Latin country.  Being a novice and yet doing my research I am interested in Italy London Ecuador or Mexico.  Our number one priority is cost of living as well as friendly family orientated culture.  Perhaps a small -medium village neat big city convenience.  Can you lead us in the right direction?  We are both quite weary of the politics and lack of caring for each other that the US is growing in.

98046,356,Dick Crockett,dixc@earthlink.net,,,,"Dear Lief and Kathleen
Perhaps a better option for the woman with the Panama Corporation and others with unused/no longer used structures might be to offer them for sale. Many starting a business would love to have a company with a record of years in existence. A business that appears to have been around for a while might be worth enough to recoup the costs of formation the annual fees and maybe even make a profit.
How many businesses boldly proclaim ""Founded in 1997"" or ""Better importing  since 2009""?
Of course ""Amanda's Fantasy Butterfly Garden"" might not suit an auto parts importing company but it could work for a restaurant. Try selling it before just allowing it to go dormant.
Thanks for all you do

98104,94,Jim Rodgers,rodgersfam1980@yahoo.com,USA,,,"Dear Kathleen:   

In your recent ""Why  Go Offshore in The First Place?"" email the following statements was attributed to Lief: 

""I want to be in a country where either everyone has a gun or no one has a gun.'

Lief's comment about being ""in a country where either everyone has a gun or no one has a gun"" is important to me.  In my case I want to live in a country where I can legally keep and bear arms for personal self-defense to include defense of my own family should that ever become necessary.  We live in Idaho precisely because it is one of the most-free states in the USA in terms of firearms rights.   I simply would not live in any country where I cannot defense myself and my family.

However I've not been able to find any reliable information on the gun laws of any countries outside of the United States and even less information of the gun laws as applied to visitors or permanent residents.   What information I've found is I believe suspect...because after all the internet is still the internet and making decision on such important matter based only on internet-derived information could end quite badly.

Could you please address this in a future newsletter?  More importantly could you refer me to an appropriate source of reliable vetted information on this topic vis-a-vis living overseas?

Many thanks

98167,15,steve,loveyourthoughts@gmail.com,949 689-8998,ane time home after 6pm or weekend,USA,"Positive a fully vested pension. I can demenstrate myself to be a low income poverty level citizen unfortunately I am on medical and snap food assistance. However although my pension was earned prior to my IRS troubles. They filed a lien for 06 and 07 taxes after I had made a 100.00 a month installment agreements.

Anyway I know this is a very  involved issue that likely would need more than one expert to guide me. I am urrently two years and 6 months from receiving the pension and while I have been earning next to nothing the past 8 years my best year was 35000 the 8 years prior to that my worst year was 141000. Anyhow  I hope I am not wasting your time no repy necesssary if that is the case. I have no other assets at this time although I am just beginning a new position with a wonderful upside.

What precipitated this change was a comment I read on the Nomad Capitalist website regarding a deplorable experience with CAYE INTERNATIONAL BANK LTD from a former customer that they screwed over.

Here it is in its entirety:

PalÂ â€¢Â 3 months ago
""Please be aware that any list of offshore banks recommended should exclude Caye International in Belize. I got burned by them during their lock out last year and the the list of lies that they told me and the damage they did to my offshore life DUE to their lies rather than tell me the truth and doing the things they said they would do ending up costing my a small business deal of 30k and personally over 20K is costs scrambling to survive and re-establish myself. I just cannot stress what a bunch liars and I mean every person I dealt with lied to me over and over again at Caye Int Bank in Belize. Being lied to by the people in a foreign land that are sitting on your money ....that is not a bank...that is a trap door waiting to send you down a dark black hole when you least expect it...I know from experience. Please don't recommend this bank to expats.""

[Source: http://nomadcapitalist.com/2016/12/14/offshore-companys-bank-account-closed/]

After reading this I came to the conclusion that Peter Zipper is not an honorable businessman and that it would be a great risk to trust his bank with any amount of my money.

Do you still recommend CAYE INTERNATIONAL BANK Lief and if so can you PLEASE tell me WHY (in light of the above revelation)????

Your wife's email lists six countries as the best off-shore banking jurisdictions with Panama being one of them. I seem to recall a publication last year where you mentioned Panama wouldn't simply open an account for just anyone. So what are the requirements for opening a bank account in Panama? Residency?

First a little intro:
My name is Giacomo Costa Italian 45 years old. I live in MÃ©xico and I'm almost broke. No sad story to tell just always worked and enjoyed since I moved to MÃ©xico almost four years ago made wrong choices and burned all my savings. 
I follow you guys since the beginning of your adventure in PanamÃ¡. I would have invested in several of the opportunities you presented in the past few years expecially the agro-plays but never had enough money (or balls).
Long story short I want to invest in the avocado plantation in PanamÃ¡ before the deadline on friday but I have no money at all.
 I need a loan to purchase a parcel from you or anybody might be interested. Here is my offer: 5000 dollar per year for 15 years starting from year one (first payment after 365 days from the loan date) for a total of 75000 dollar. The title (and revenues) of the land as a collateral even if I miss just one payment.
I know it sound crazy because it is crazy and risky expecially for me I'd say since the title of the land would be the collateral but I'm willing to risk; we have only one shot after all. What about you? Please answer. My cell is +52 55(1) 16930664.

98410,156,Martyn Clark,readyabout.clark@gmail.com,,,Canada,"Hi Lee

Having lived aboard our 48ft ketch for six years and logged (collectively) around 200000 miles at sea my wife and I found your recent report for expat boat lovers excellent. We ran into a sailor in Zihuatanejo this past winter who keeps his sailboat in Barra de Navidad and cruises the Pacific coast of Mexico each winter and gave that arrangement 2 thumbs up. (He summers back home in the States.) In Costa Rica Golfito is becoming a bolt hole for cruisers. No hurricanes in Ecuador (another bonus for that great expat haven) and cheap digs and the yacht club at Salinas are a good option; however the cruising is a bit humdrum unless you go to Galapagos where extended stays are a problem. Islas Perlas in Panama is a wonderful cruising ground but the marina in Panama just outside the Pacific entrance to the canal is expensive: best to drift north and hole up in the cheapy 'yacht club' in David. One caveat for all expat boat owners wanting to leave their vessels for extended stays in foreign countries: most countries have limitations on the time you can leave your boat there without being subject to import duties. Check before you go!

This winter we're off to the little known back waters of South India. The red tape is extensive for foreign boat owners so we'll just hire a boat and skipper!

Fair winds

I run a ""down to earth industrial high tech project"" for which I need funding BUT it offers BY FAR a much better risks to return ratio as real estate and also exit possible in one year only.  Debt / equity / hybrid all is OK but the deal is we need to reach at least 5 to 10 M or I avoid to start the project (as risk increases)

If that is something we might share please let's have a Skype talk ideally with your CFO or the like :)  And operations can be done where wished I am able to grow it from most countries in the world

Just read your description of AT&T dividend which is almost a lock at 5%.  I'm  74 and haven't been an investor for 10 years but this is certainly intriguing.  I'm wondering precisely which stock to buy to get that 5% and whether you have any other stock that is as good or better from a dividend standpoint.  I need to be cautious but 5% or close would be powerful for my goals.  Not greedy but still needy!

We are soon to be living outside the United States on a permanent basis. We will be relying solely on a defined benefit pension from a local governmental agency. This is a PERS pension. I have federal taxes automatically taken out. We will be permanent residents of Mexico. Is there any way to reduce or get a refund on these taxes? Any info would be greatly appreciated.

I have been looking at property in Lisbon as I think it offers more lifestyle opportunities than in the Algarve.  I have found prices in Lisbon to be very high in a number of neighborhoods not just Chiado and Baixa Barrio Alto etc. The asking prices are like 5k Euro per sq meter in most of the other neighoborhoods Lapa Estrala Santos and surrounding areas. if seems the locals want to cash in and I don't know what is a reasonable percentage to attempt to ask for a discount from the locals. Property seems to be selling fast even at these prices. At these types of prices you could buy similar property in a number of countries.  Looking at Cascias as well instead of the Algarve Any thoughts? Thanks

98871,156,Victoria,vicschillinger@gmail.com,,,USA,Hi Lee I love Playa del Carmen in Mexico and am finally at a point in life where I can afford to buy a place there.  I have to still live in the US for now but would like to have an investment property in a place that I love and a second home I could live in outside the US when I can get out.  My question to you is how to tell if that market has run up so much that it's at the top.  Playa del Carmen still seems to be going strong and given rental income I could make 10% on my investment but I of course don't want to buy at the top of the market and feel like a chump.  Any advice on how to know if it's hit the peak or there is still upward progression in store besides having a crystal ball?  HaHa thanks!  Victoria,2017-07-08,,

Have enjoyed your and Kathleen's newsletters for a couple years now.  After selling a business 3 years ago we decided to take 6 months leave from our Southern California beach  home and travel France Italy and Spain (home schooling our 8 yr old for the first time)  with the idea of potentially relocating.  
We returned through Montreal QC and fell in love with the city and have been here for 1 1/2 years! ( and yes the winters are long  and cold but fun filled and a novelty never before experienced) My wife has just been accepted to a Masters fashion photography program at a prestigious school in Paris and is looking for a small apartment to rent while at school this September (we will fly back and forth throughout the year).  Here school is in the 11th arrondissement. Any recommendations for rental assistance is appreciated. 
PS: I travel extensively and still have other businesses in the US and internationally and am interested in your global investment approach but feel it can be more institutionally driven ....love to chat with you sometime about that.

I am a Chicago native and current Bay Area resident who has been inspired by your story and enjoyed receiving your newsletters.  I'm in my early 40's now raising a young family.  I have a good career but am focused on building out a real estate portfolio and passive income stream.  
I am a passionate world traveler and dream of a life that combines travel with real estate investment.
I recently purchased my first investment property a duplex in Ft. Worth TX and am looking towards my next move.
I'd say my biggest problem with all of your newsletters and the global opportunities to invest is where to start.  It's a bit overwhelming trying to figure out what might be the best move now or next.

I'd welcome any guidance you can provide to help me continue the path of a successful global real estate investor

Regards

Now the thing is that he got some legal problems several years ago. Nothing criminal just simple lawsuits which one he lost and ending up with a small fine.
Two Panama banks refused his business; no more explication given. His lawyer says he can't do anything about it. He is a straight guy which was abused by others. He has bank accounts in Canada in the US and even one in Europe... they all know his story and call him Sir. My opinion is that the lawyer is a coward not wanting the bank to paint him in a corner or 'delist' his business for having merely argued about their position.
Have a suggestion about hat he should do ?

Yes thatâ€™s what a foreign trust does best. 
Note though that some countries donâ€™t recognize trusts. In this case you could put the property into an LLC and then place the LLC in the trust.

I don't have an IRA LLC or a trust. Is there a benefit to buying real estate via one of these or some other entities versus just buying in one's own name as just an individual regular person? If so what?

I am visiting Cartagena Colombia next August 24th to explore the city. I decided seeing this city first against MedellÃ­n because it's ocean front which I like. I would like for you if it's possible to tell me where I could get info on renting and buying apartments maybe refer me to one or two realtors. I am considering a one bedroom apartment in a building which will start construction soon being built by 'Araujo & Segovia' builders and developers at approximately $40000.00.
I would greatly appreciate your counseling on this.
Also some places of interest to visit will be great.
Thank you.

I'm a Forex trader and nowadays I trade for myself only but I'm getting prepared to start trading for other people and would like to know the possibilities not only to protect myself (the earned money which comes from trading) but mostly to avoid taxes if possible.

After some research I got interested in a ""Belize Corporation with St. Vincent and Grenadines Bank Account"" and would like to know if that would be a good solution for what I'm looking for.

I'm a Brazilian citizen live in Brazil and would like to start planting those 2 flags in 2017. Also I think of moving to Portugal in a couple of years.

Would that be a good strategy to begin with?

So my question is;   why is your business one largely targeting people with limited income not seemingly considering how many can't afford a $1000.+ to attend your seminars - but would surely pay $50. or more to access a site that enabled them to view the seminar live and esp. then on tape where it could be seen until and to promote the next event.  Also it could incorporate a link with I'm sure you as an affiliate  to all other information from all your speakers. Also obviously a great way  to prominently display in one place all of your publications and promotions
As one who has helped others add more profit to their better ideas and assuming that many things have been tried or considered to make the most from the seminars I'd really be interested to know what it is I haven't considered.      
I do hope this gets to where it was intended as I would like to thank you for all the helpful information I've received from your emails. It's made a fantasy into an undaunted  possibility. And that  as they say.. is Priceless Continued success.    JSTurnbull ",2017-07-25,Turnbull,

I was just curious I saw your post on the chacras in Uruguay and noticed that you have been a resident of Uruguay for 6 years. Is there any reason in particular that you have not become a citizen? I know you spend most of your time in Mexico have you gotten Mexican citizenship yet?

This doesn't have to be featured in the ""Letter to the editor"" section just curious about your experience in Uruguay. It sounds interesting to me but I am mixed half black and white. I have heard that Uruguay may not naturalize someone if they don't feel they are ""Uruguayan"" (European) enough. Have you heard about that or found it to be the case. Right now Uruguay isn't in my residency plan but just always has been on my radar as I went there several years ago and really like the remoteness of it.

Didn't you say at a conference that if you do have to pay income taxes in another country that you can get credited for that payment on your US return thus avoiding double taxation?  So paying income tax in another country isn't being taxed extra. Correct?  So what's the big deal?  :),2017-07-26,,offshore-site-contact-form

And I believe that she is now located in Corozal Bay (which is the location I am considering).  I wonder if she will share a little more about where she decided to locate: the choices in the city on the outskirts of town residences in neighborhoods or gated community etc.  And one specific Q I have is:  could you please explain how it is to go shopping in Chetumal?  how are you able to get your purchases back home to Corozal?  how do you go through the border?  (I only need one Walmart ""fix"" maybe every 6 months or so but would like to understand if it really is possible to do that and bring things home.)

If you want to get two three or four times more for that same Greenback in your wallet itâ€™s time you looked further afield while you still have the chance"".

That down-trend has already begun. When I arrived in Europe 3 months back the exchange rate was around $1.10 to a Euro. Today it's $1.17 to a Euro.

My name is Sally and I am writing because my parents are on the cusp of retirement but like many people their age they are worried about whether it will be ok financially or not. They also have a few healthcare concerns and despite being eligible for medicare soon they worry the out-of-pocket expenses are going to bankrupt them.

As the Content Manager for a small financial advice site I felt it important we cover this topic. We have produced an article containing the top 7 financial concerns of people about to retire including healthcare costs. It contains advice on how to deal with each of the problems outlined. I know you are busy but you can check out the article here: https://www.bestliferates.org/seniors/most-stressful-financial-concerns/. 

Recently I came across offshorelivingletter.com and having read https://www.offshorelivingletter.com/paying-medical-care-hospital-costs-overseas/ I feel this is a subject you would like to cover. If you would like to add it as a resource thatâ€™d be great however. I am also more than happy to write a brief introduction or summary for you to put on your website.

Please let me know what you think!

Having spent a day at the border watching the wrecks that are brought in beautified and resold in Belize I would only buy a vehicle from an established dealer (i.e. the official Ford or Toyota dealer) new or from someone I knew so I could know the history of the vehicle.  Even if it is not a resurrected wreck you cannot know how hard the vehicle has been driven on Belize's rocky roads.

You might refer folks to the article I wrote earlier on vehicles in Belize.  We have done the trip from California through Texas to Belize twice and went without incident both times.",2017-08-03,,

99862,156,Marcia Ryan,marcia.j.ryan@gmail.com,,,USA,"Hi Lee
I met you at the Mexico conference last September.  Would you consider putting together a real estate tour of Mexico?  Cabo San Lucas Puerto Vallarta or Mazatlan San Miguel de Allende Merida Tulum Oaxaca and ???  There are many to choose from but these would be my choices.  And you have lots of knowledge experience and contacts.  Plus it would be FUN!  I just went to Belize on such a trip and really enjoyed seeing so many cities in the country the homes/condos/apartments available and pricing.  I am going to Panama next month on the same type of trip with someone whom I met on the Belize trip.  Don't be surprised if she also contacts you about doing this type of trip around Mexico as she is looking to relocate sooner than later.

When I was at the Mexico conference last year the one comment made by several of my fellow participants and myself was the need to hear about and see the rental market in the various towns/cities.  If you are only looking for an investment property then that is a different matter but for those of us looking to relocate we want to know about the rentals for us to ""try out"" a city or an area of a city/town.

Thanks for sharing.

Regarding LLCs offshore property and IRAs.   Here's my positive experience. You advised  looking at an agricultural play in Brazil a few years ago. I got in on the ground floor.  Very stable and profitable. FIRST I did extensive research and trips to the site and got to know the principles. Short of extracting their DNA I know everything about them their history and the project. Short of a military coup or a meteor strike in Brazil the investment is grand!  I used my IRA money.  I also converted it to ROTH aggressively over 5 years.  It will save me a few hundred thousand in taxes over 10-15 years even though the tax bite was stiff up front.  For excellent asset protection I've Placing the real estate in domestic LLCs within the ROTH IRA along with a well constructed trust have given me excellent asset protection and the ability to move ownership offshore whenever I desire.  I am waiting a year or two longer to set up an offshore residence so I do not have to stress about ""reporting"" requirements for foreign bank accounts. In the meantime I'm setting my financial foundation from the USA.
Your advice has been very spot on and extremely helpful.
Thank you Leif.

100083,94,Kathleen Miller,kamillertime@gmail.com,,,,I enjoy your publication so much!   I need to try to locate an article you wrote in the last few months (I believe) about an area in France 60 miles from the border with Spain; where almost everyone speaks  English; and where 2 people can live on about $1000 USD per month.  I KNOW I read this information but I cannot locate the actual article or newsletter.  Can you help please?  I think it was in a newsletter about France in general with a particular focus on this area.   Thank you SO MUCH!,2017-08-11,,mailbag-2018

The wife and I are selling our home in Colorado with plans to retire in Mexico. Because playing pickleball is a must for us we are only considering places where there is an established pickleball community. San Felipe San Carlos and Los Barriles all fit that description. 
I was wondering how familiar you are with pickleball and if so have you  ever written an article about pickleball communities? If not you might find it to be a good subject that a lot of your subscribers would appreciate.

I work with US based clients purchasing resorts and businesses in the country of Belize.  Currently I am trying to assist one of my clients with establishing a US checking account for his Belizean corporation at our local US Bank.  He needs the US account to process customer payments and pay bills originating in the US.  

He has a Minnesota based LLC which bought 100% of shares of an existing Belize corporation.  The seller is also a US citizen.

The bank is telling us the process could be difficult because share purchase documents are not sufficient they cannot use a Belize tax ID number and the process could take longer than 3 months.  

Do you have any recommendations of banks that are more open to helping US citizens open accounts for foreign corporations?

Thank you for your guidance

The new visa stamp says if you are involved in any kind of employment on your tourist visa you can be deported including volunteer work unless you have special permission from the government. My wife is on her 3rd year of trying to get residency. If we'd known then what we know now we would not even applied and just keep going with the work visa.

I lived in Mexico City in '68 and '69 while teaching at the U. of the Americas which is now housed in Puebla.  I also spent much of the '80s and '90s in Chapala.
I just read your August 2016 article on Zika-free living but could not access the photos of the residences that you described in Puebla.  Is there some way you could help me do this.  
    About Puebla  How much would a live-in maid cost monthly?  What are the medical facilities like? Even though I live in the Boston area  I go to Guadalajara/Chapala  to visit my DDS regularly.  I am 78 yrs. old and would definitely appreciate some live-in help.
     I love your articles keep up this great research.  The last time was in Chapala dengue fever carrying mosquitos were prevalent.  That is why I need to be a little higher in altitude.   Thanks so much   xoxo  Jean",2017-08-18,,

Once in the capital and once in Punta Cana - I was impressed by the people and their obvious pride in their country.  I am also very interested in Belize though I have never been there.  Do you have some comparison info between these two?  Also are there any laws concerning the US being able to demand the expates return to the US.  No we are not criminals we are just two seniors wanting some peace in our lives.  My mates brother is very wealthy but he is a control freak and is constantly making our lives here unbelievably miserable.  There is no peace as long as he is in our lives.

Thanks for your message. It reminds me of a time nearly 20 years ago when I was in my late 30s running my own business and raising a young family.  For the first time in 6 or 7 years we had a pretty sharp drop in business revenues (agricultural consulting) and I was looking for a way to supplement my income.  I stumbled upon a guy named Wade Cook who wrote books and presented financial seminars.  I discovered writing covered calls at one of his seminars and took to it immediately. This one strategy allowed me to get through a couple of difficult income years and make some great money.  My business took off again and I started doing more international consulting so I just stopped doing options (it was a bit boring and flying off to Latin America or Asia was more interesting).  Now later in my career selling covered calls looks very attractive again as a supplement to my work in the non-profit sector that typically doesn't pay amazingly well.  

My question is do you offer a seminar or short course on selling options ?  I would want to brush up on this before I dive in again.  Thanks so much for your assistance.

What are rights as owner if you have a problem with a rental property tenant in Medellin?
I have a property manager who put the problem tenant in place but the tenant has stopped paying rent.  What should clauses should be in the contract between me and the property management to handle this case and how do i get rid of the tenant if the property manager has proven to be inept even though his references checked out?  What rights do i have to get the tenant out.
Do you have the name of someone in Medellin who can help me deal with this?

100672,94,Kelly,kgiving@yahoo.com,,,,"Thank you for all the recent information about considering Europe. We have been in Barcelona for almost 2 years now  and we love it.  And it was very affordable until we discovered the wealth tax which is paid annually based on your net worth.  Government pensions are excluded but how many people have them anymore?  So if you have saved and invested all your life you will pay dearly each year. They reinstated it a few years ago and there is no word on whether they will suspend it again. Interestingly some cities provide a 100% deduction (ex. Madrid but not Barcelona.) Our local accountant suggested that we only report our largest retirement account but we still would have to pay approx. $15000 this year.  The other concern is the weakening dollar.  In January it was the highest it had been in recent years so we transferred as large an amount as we could afford. Now it is the lowest it has been - down $0.15 this year (~0.80 euro  per $1 usd.)  The speculation is that it might fall a little more or go back up a little - Who knows?  So not as affordable as we had hoped.

We will probably move to South America ( Medellin or Santiago) next year and maybe live in BCN 6 months a year (less than 183 days) so as not to incur any tax liability.  Do you have any comments or suggestions (besides the most affordable European locale the Algarve?)

Thanks again for your many years of great and honest advice.

I've been following your materials and some of it is outstanding.

In the near future I'm looking to attain tax-residency in a country that has very low taxation while not requiring excessive time spent  there or investments.

I hold a German passport and am retired with income from online businesses and captital gains.

If you have any ideas which countries or residency programs might be suitable please let me know.

100721,356,Meredith DuHamel,meredith1581@yahoo.com,949-290-4483,,,Sometimes I feel as if you guys give us mixed messages. First you tell us that we should always rent first in an area before buying so that we can find out if we really like the area. I didn't do this and purchased a lot in La Paz Mexico for $50K in 1995--found out that I didn't want to live there and the lot is now worth about $23K! But I digress. Anyway I feel as if the rest of the information in your various publications urges us readers to BUY properties overseas right away. Maybe this would work for those of us who have enough money to both invest overseas and buy a place to live. But I am not one of those lucky few. I need to live in the place that I purchase. And now I am VERY gun-shy after my rather poor decision in La Paz. Any thoughts? I THINK that I want to live in France...,2017-09-01,,offshore-site-contact-form

Hi I'd like to know details regarding this investment. Are we able to select the lot that is purchased and titled?
Also how is the revenue stream calculated? Is the calculation made as a whole - from the entire project or is the production from each individual 1Hectare lot calculated separately?
Are the expected returns net or gross? Ie â€“ are these figures of the returns after or before the management commission/fees are deducted?
I think it is quite expensive when considered on a per hectare basis but I am very interested.
Is the purchase process quick? When will this AVOCADO project get underway?

I just would like to say that Panama wants us here!

The Belizean visa program needs to be evaluated and changed if they want more expats/money to come into their country.
If you come on a visitors visa you have to go to the office' to pay to stay' every 30 days then leave every 6 months.The retirees visa wants guaranteed $2000 a month!
Oh and the Internet charges are unbelievable! 

I looked into Belize because it is an English speaking country but forget itI love Panama!

101169,94,MariLynne Craig,bmcraig51@gmail.com,,,,"In your Sept 12 newsletter you made a statement about permanent residency in Belize that is erroneous and misleading to anyone wanting to obtain permanent residency there. You said ""At the same time you donâ€™t have to be physically present year-round in the country to qualify for permanent residency and to take advantage of the tax benefits of that status. Come to visit for as few as four weeks a year and your status remains intact."" In fact in order to get permanent residency you cannot leave Belize for more than 14 days collectively during a year before residency is granted or you have to start back at the beginning. You need to live in Belize for one year before you can apply for permanent residency then after you apply you still cannot leave (except for the 14 days) until you get the residency status which could take up to another 3 years.  The statement you made applies to QRP (Qualified Retired Persons). Just thought I should point that out so you can make an amendment. Otherwise people may be very disappointed when they find out about the requirements for permanent residency.",2017-09-13,,mailbag-2018

101230,156,Dave Carlson,decarlson5@gmail.com,,,U.S.,"      Good morning Lee!  (I just realized I'm writing this on Mexico's independence day [Sat. the 16th] so I hope you're having a fun time down there.)
      I've enjoyed listening to your and Gregory Derksen's LIOS 2016 Mexico presentations a few times and they're quite informative and entertaining so thank you!  After living in the Phoenix area for nearly 37 years I would like to experience the Pacific Ocean and Mazatlan really looks like a good spot to give it a try.  (In fact I've been planning my move for a while now and I'm leaving within the next 10 days or so.)
      I'll be crossing the border at Nogales; I have my Mexico Visa attached to my passport; I'll be taking my household goods in a small trailer.
      I hope you can answer a few questions for me:  Is Mexico's state highway # 15 a safe four-lane highway all the way to Mazatlan? ... and of course I'll be travelling only during the daytime.  I agree with you -- it's a 2- 2 1/2-day trip for me -- can you recommend  place(s) to stay along the way?
      Is there a chance you could recommend an apartment area for me in Mazatlan? -- I'm interested in the quiet more residential northern areas such as the Marina and Cerritos. I'm hoping I can find the imm. offices in Mazatlan as soon as I get there to obtain my residency card and maybe the truck permit / registration?
      I'm sorry: this message is getting too long.  I do have some info. on the Nogales Mexican consulate ... I believe some of the requirements are a bit different than the one in Phoenix.
      I'll also write to Gregory Derksen about maybe finding an apartment in Mazatlan (I'll be only a renter for at least a while in Mexico). 
      Again thanks very much for all your contributions to LIOS -- I've heard you at a few conferences but never had the chance to come up and shake your hand.
      Best regards Dave C.
P.S.  Hope to see you on the boardwalk some day!

Assisted Living costs nowhere near the amount you allege (Specialized Memory Care perhaps but again both parents do not need this).  You also conveniently left Social Security And Medicare out of the equation.  Together they would cover Assisted Living even in the highest cost states (but not Memory Care).  Even Long Term Care Insurance only pays for a short period of Memory Care.  Bottom line:  When you run out of money as much as you may not want to you rely on tXpYer assistance.

101277,376,Neil,neilp49@gmail.com,,,Colombia/ Mexico,Hi Steve I really enjoy your thoughtful but provocative articles. A solution for the UNAFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE COSTS in Retirement Homes and Assisted Living facilities is the consider relocating overseas. I realize this may not be for everyone.  But for those who cannot afford  these places in the US. for whatever reason it makes sense to broaden one's options ! Rather than become a burden on one's family for such expensive care looking elsewhere may not be a bad alternative ? Mexico and Colombia maybe a couple of places to look into ?  Planning now for the future outside the US. no matter how scary maybe the only solution for a lot of people. I realize  not planning for the future previously is what has gotten many people in this predicament now . Maybe just maybe  it's not too late !!!Thanks Steve. ,2017-09-18,,

101304,94,Scott ,okmortgageteam@gmail.com,(250) 861-7070,,Canada,Hi Kathleen I am from Canada and been reading your publications I believe for at least a year now.  I have visions of heading off to sun sand and warm waters to escape the Canadian winters & just find a more peaceful life style to live my remaining days.  I like the idea of an expat community.  Belize I find very intriguing because of all it does have to offer plus the close proximity to home & family left behind.  Where I keep getting tripped up in my head (and fearful) I do NOT have a pension income and my nest egg is my pension.  I only have approx 120k USD at the moment.   I am working on a laptop business (trading) but it is not mature enough yet to support me so internet connection is very important.  Being self employed most of my life has limited my pensionable options so I must preserve what I have and live off what I can earn from it.  If all someone had in the world is approx $120k USD would that be enough to get into a income producing property situation or some other kind of business opportunity in Belize and get me near the ocean?  My longer term plan was  to jump in but a very recent divorce robbed me of my plans and half (or more) of my nest egg.  Any help or comments would be very much appreciated.            ,2017-09-18,Mason,

A few weeks ago I contacted one of your sales reps for additional information as part of my due diligence (e.g. recently audited statements - payout projections are OK but I'm more interested in the financial management of the operations; an investor to contact to learn of his/her experiences). Have not received anything yet. Additionally some of the information reported in the mkt brochure is either misleading or untrue. For example Midas is NOT a key partner to IFoam Organics but a member to organization. Neither is Midas is a key partner with World Aquaculture Society.  I checked.   I know promotion is huge for LIOS various ventures - I get that...but to attract more diligent investors you may want to look into these discrepancies.

I've been reading your newsletters for a while now and appreciate all the great information. It has really encouraged me to think seriously about moving out of the USA. 
I went to Puerto Vallarta last February to get certified to teach English but had to return home right after so I never did start teaching English. 
My question for you is I am considering moving to Mexico. I'm thinking of Mazatlan PV or somewhere around Cancun/Cozamel.Yucatan or maybe one of the smaller mountainous cities. I know that's not very specific but I haven't been to the mountains or Mazatlan yet and would still like to explore. I think it would be cooler in the mountains and more enjoyable weather.  (Any recommendations for very cool small cities)?

My husband and I are discussing a vacation home in Puerta Vallarta and are traveling there next month for a visit. Although we have been there as tourists we are not completely familiar with the different areas of town.  Could you suggest a good realtor that would we willing to show us the different areas while presenting the pros and cons of each so that we could narrow down our choices? Also are you familiar with any documentation that we could read that describes that kind of information?

Inga and I attended your conference in  Panama in 2016 and spent 3 weeks traveling from Boquete the Azuero Peninsula Coronado and Panama City. Enjoyed the trip but realized that  Panama was likely not for us for any number of reasons.

We've spent time in  Puerto Rico Ecuador and Dominican Republic and look forward to our visit this fall to Puerto Vallarta and this coming summer to the Algarve.

Thus far I'm not ""feeling it"" in terms of a place we'd like to spend time as a place to live. I'm beginning to suspect that we will not find what we're hoping for in the developing world as far as a longer term hang out. The third world aspects of lack of development (read convenience) may be the deal breaker for these places.  This is probably more so for my wife than myself but that adds up to the we in this partnership.

We are nearing permanent residency in DR and aiming for a passport but I'm not sure it is a place that will ever be more than a few month hang out per year. And frankly the cost of living is not inexpensive there either. So the pros don't do much to overcome these cons. But does reflect a commitment to a plan B for residency and I'm happy about this.

It appears to me at this point that lower cost developed-world destinations are more viable in terms of a balance of convenience and cost of living including housing and healthcare.

That is why I have added the Algarve to our visitation list and as a prospect for retirement. I am also very interested in Spain as a low-cost warm climate Mediterranean location. 

As you make your plans for 2018 I would definitely like to hear more about southern Spain.

Thanks for allowing me to bend your ear for a moment or two.

We appreciate your work.

101463,94,Nonnie Wilson,nonnie_families_first@copper.net,,,,We bought a home in a small village (Ajijic) Mexico. It is an informal quaint colorful peaceful place with many cultural activities interesting and diverse people and a lovely relationship between the local Mexican families. Inexpensive but if you want to spend money  it's a five hour bus trip to the coast! There are modern stores as well traditional  Mexican ones. We drive a golf cart at all hours up and around the cobble stone streets.  Great places to eat and concerts or a play a few times a week. The weather is excellent (70') most of the year...except May is a wee bit hot!  We feel safe and love that our kids and friends from the west coast (Portland Oregon) can visit  easily. We have found many very interesting and meaningful volunteer projects which  three generations in our family work on.  When we have needed medical help the doctor often will offer to come to our home! To date we have gotten excellent dental and medical care.  Our family highly recommends Ajijic to anyone who might be interested in an informal stimulating and relaxed life style on Lake Chapala (which we do not recommend swimming in but kayaking is great). Hope you will come visit....our investment has increased greatly already. ,2017-09-22,,mailbag-2018

After 15 years of transiting Panama and subscribing to your newsletters and attending some of your courses - I will assume permanent residency in Panama in 2018  coming from a country without a tax treaty with Panama . I have a substantial portfolio of stocks that I regularly trade and must move this from my birth country to avoid withholding taxes. Panama has a poor history of Stock Brokers ( like the ""Wall Street"" group ) and very few tax treaties and no tax treaty with the USA . I need expert advice on where to place my stock portfolio and perhaps you are considering offering a course for investors like me  or know of an expert I can consult with . At this point it appears my best option might be Interactive Brokers from the USA  but this is an internet only business. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

I live about 40 miles north of the Mexican border in Sahuarita AZ with my wife and her two young boys. I am on Medicare but I pay for health insurance for her and the boys ($663.00 per month). Most doctors here will not accept it but I have to have it to prevent being fined by the US Government. Whenever someone needs a doctor â€” whether a GP Pediatrician Orthopedic Surgeon whatever â€” or a hospital we go to Nogales Sonora to the doctors and hospitals that have been caring for them for a long time. I pay cash which is cheaper than the copay would be if we saw a US doctor and he accepted the US insurance. My question is: can I buy Mexican or International insurance for them and drop the US insurance? My wife owns two home in Nogales Sonora and they are all still citizens of Mexico although the do have Green Cards and live here with me five days a week. I would greatly appreciate your input.

We are in our mid 70's and are going to Medellin and especially interested in researching Envigado Laurelas and Sabaneta for long term living.  I would like to meet over the web with some expats around our age and ""talk"" about their findings input advice etc. before we go there in December.

What is the best way to find and contact expats our age there?  I have lived in Indonesia briefly Iran decades ago (during the Shah time off course) and traveled much in my life and I think Colombia is my next ""stop"".

Can you contact me at my email and help as you did once long ago that led us to Argentina.

101923,94,Sally Keys,sally@diamondmail.net,,,,"Hi There

I am writing because my niece is now old enough to learn to drive and pass her test. We were all very happy for her but as a former financial advisor I know how difficult it can be to get insurance as a teenage driver. One of the main reasons for this is the high number of accidents involving young drivers. It is therefore important to give teenage drivers as much advice and support as possible.

My name is Sally and I am now the Content Manager for a small insurance advice website. I know you are busy so I wonâ€™t take too much of your time. We have researched key driving safety tips for young drivers which you can find here: https://www.plymouthrock.com/resource-center/insurance-101/teen-driver-tips. 

While researching a new article I came across liveandinvestoverseas.com. Our article seemed like a natural fit and I was wondering if you would add it to https://www.liveandinvestoverseas.com/infocus-belize/driving-in-belize/ as a resource link if thatâ€™s possible? If not I would love to write an introduction summary or blog post on teen driving tips which you could then post on liveandinvestoverseas.com. 

Please let me know if we can work together.

Best Regards
Sally",2017-10-01,,mailbag-2018

My name is Aymeric Cormerais and I'm an investor and real estate agent/advisor in Paris France. I work in a real estate agency named Une Maison Bleue located near Champs Elysees.

I follow your newsletter and I just saw that you will have an event in Paris soon.

I really like and relate with your work as I also look for opportunities around the globe.

I'm not asking for anything I'd just be glad if I can help you.

Do you have anyone helping you finding deals in France and giving you advice about how it works in France ?

How long will you stay in Paris ? I'd love to meet you and your team (I have the best parisian restaurants adresses as my fiancee is a food blogger)

Best regards
Aymeric

I am a Florida resident and I have never been to South America.  I am planning on going to Colombia to visit the family of a friend of mine who is a Colombian national.  I would like to stay there for 180-182 days.  My question is: in addition to my U.S. Passport do I need a VISA?  We will be flying into Bogota and staying in the greater Bogota area.  Besides answering my VISA question do you have any other tips or advice for me?  Please share any thoughts that you may have regarding my trip.
(You and I met and talked a few times at an Orlando conference in September or early October 2015.)   Thank you in advance for your reply.

Sehgal,baba37@protonmail.com,7184264434,,,"I recently read your clear and excellent (as usual) mailbag explanation about legal residency vs. tax residency in the context of establishing multiple legal residencies taking into account ""time in country"" requirements.  Could you tell me in the case of Hungary at what point in time I would be considered a tax resident if I chose to establish legal residency there. I am an American citizen by birth but I also have Hungarian citizenship and a Hungarian (EU) passport based upon my father's legacy (born in Budapest).  My only source of income is U. S. social security and a New York State government pension so perhaps (?) even if designated a tax resident in Hungary I would not be liable anyway for any income taxes due to the fact that many countries (except the U.S.) exempt these sources of income from tax.  I am currently a New York State resident.  I would very much appreciate your view on my specific situation or provision of a referral to a professional who you trust and work with to answer this question.

102312,156,Brenda Nelson,brendasmaildesk@gmail.com,,,USA and Brazil,"For 4 years now I have been researching to create a plan for a life abroad but there are so many gorgeous options it is impossible to know what to do first and where to turn. I am American first language...English but I've lived in Brazil speak Portuguese and have spent a little time in Costa Rica and speak Spanish as well.  
My exchange year as a teen gave me a love of everything international but my marriage and family kept me in a small town in Pennsylvania. My kids are all grown now and for the last 4 years since my divorce I've looked all over for opportunities to live and work abroad. So many opinions websites expat sources etc I have reached overwhelm and I fear ""analysis paralysis."" 
I find myself always coming back to International Living and it's family of publications and people with extreme regularity though. I first subscribed to IL in 2004 so long time on and off reader of I think everything this network publishes. I have attended AWAI's writing and photography events and feel at home with the folks there.
I know there is no certain answer for this question but ideally I'd like to snowbird between the US and Brazil (unless I find employment that regularly takes me back and forth). I have looked at Turks and Caicos as well. I would like to purchase a 3-4 unit place in one or both locations rent for income and couple that with the writing and photography while I travel. 
As far as purchasing the RE I don't have much to start with I need to start a business find investors and service that with proceeds from rents. I have created spreadsheets with some numbers that I need to make this work but...
In your experience am I pipe dreaming or could this actually work? 
Do you have information on anyone in Brazil or Turks and Caicos that could help? I have friends in Brazil who say they will help but ..jeito Brazileiro... things aren't happening very quickly. 
I am currently with my sister and brother in law until I get established and would love to free them of their house guest as quickly as possible. Time isn't truly an issue they are so wonderful and haven't given me a ""exit date"" yet but I've been here 6 months and feel I should/could be further ahead on my plans. Instead I am feeling deeper in overwhelm.
I appreciate any guidance direction or contacts...especially what to do first who to turn to for reliable help etc.
Thank you for your time and consideration!
Brenda

This January I purchased a hectare of avocado trees-to-be in Panama following one of your suggested investments for diversification. At first I heard several times from the company but it is now 10 months since my purchase and I have still seen no sign of title documents nor have I received any recent emails from the company informing me of reasons for the delay. I have also written to them and received no response. Naturally I am worried since I have no idea if titling normally takes this long in Panama--while a lot I purchased later in Brazil already issued the title documents to me in about August. Please please tell me there is a good reason for the lack of response from this company and the unconscionable delay in issuing the title documents. I would have thought that maintaining contact with investors and explaining any delays would be a first principle in customer relations but apparently that is not so with this company impressive glossy brochure notwithstanding. I am sincerely hoping that I have not thrown away the proceeds of the sale of my home on some pie-in-the sky investment from which I will be unable to benefit.
I will look forward to hearing from you about the follow-up on your recommendation.

You recently wrote about Las Terrenas Dominican Republic as being high on  your list of ideal retirement locations.  However this year the island was hit by two major hurricanes back to back - Irma and Maria.  I wanted to know if you have received any updates from Las Terrenas as to the extent of the damage there and how bad the hurricanes were.  Was the wind damage extensive?  Was there serious flooding?  How long before electric power was restored?  What was the damage to the beaches and palm trees?  What is the aftermath of the hurricanes?  How long will it take to get things back to ""normal?""  Have the hurricanes changed your opinion about Las Terrenas?  I'd appreciate any info you can give me.
Thanks!!

You like to tout agricultural opportunities such as aquaponics mango or avocado farms.
Well this idea sounded good to me so I bought a hectare of land in the Simply Natural avocado farm in Panama. The contract was signed in Jan. of 2017.
The last time I heard from the people involved in the project was in April of 2017. They sent me a short video showing trees in a field and intimated that things were coming along. At a time before I was informed that the two preliminary steps were land segregation and titling.
On Sept. 29 2017 I decided to e-mail Pauline Le Gouze at Pauline@simplynaturalinvestments.com(Panama no. 507-6558-7945). She supposedly works at Simply Natural 20th floorTower 2000 Punta Pacifica Panama City Panama. The phone(011-507-3875-216) has been disconnected. I have sent 4 or 5 e-mails with no response; also I have tried to call but the phone is always busy. She is the person who sent me an e-mail welcoming me  as an avocado farmer after the contract was signed. I simply wanted to know the status of things and to get a copy of the deed.
Also I sent 4 or 5 e-mails to another person in the office Lillian(Lillian@simplynaturalinvestments.com). The phone no. is 507-6014-4490. There has been no response to the e-mails and the phone is always busy.
I have sent e-mails to Steve Walstrom(swalstrom@liveandinvestoverseas.com(815-239-6414). I received a message that the e-mails were undeliverable. Steve was supposedly the sales director at live and Invest Global Property Solutions with whom you are affiliated. His phone was always busy.
Frank Backe a sales consultant(507-6694-2697) with whom I exchanged e-mails early in the process was another whose phone is always busy.
On Oct. 9 2017 I tried another no. 888-851-7988(Danny ?). I left a message and was surprised  to get a response from Juliana(julina@simplynaturalinvestments.com). She asked me to send her an e-mail. I did- no response.
Therefore since you have a lot of information about these investments and are affiliated with GPS I am asking you to please help me. Can you find out if this project is legitimate is still going on or have I been duped? I hate to think so but when supposedly reputable business people do not respond it does not give one a good feeling.
Thanks.
Sincerely
Albert P. Close Jr.

We are most interested in living in Europe:  Portugal Italy Spain or France  in that order  for a few years between when we qualify for my husband's pension and when we qualify for Medicare .  My husband is a type one diabetic so no international private insurance company will ensure his diabetes .  Current estimates  for both of us from CIGNA and the like will offer us insurance at more than $2000 a month without covering any diabetic related expenses .  That's too high! We  have two basic questions:  would any of these countries be likely to approve residency for us ?  And would it be possible to get cheaper insurance whether it covers my husbands diabetes or not through local in country insurance companies or travelers insurance ?  We would be happy to carry catastrophe insurance and to pay out-of-pocket for insulin and diabetic routine care .  We think we'd be strong candidates for one year residency visa because my husband's pension is generous and we have significant life savings  to prove that we are not likely to become a burden on any state.  We just don't want to pay ridiculous premiums for health care.  So basically we're trying to find out how people with pre-existing health conditions can live in Europe for 1 to 5 years or even longer and have access to affordable healthcare?  We would consider paying out-of-pocket for all medical expenses affordable compared to US prices but we need health insurance to apply for visas.  Would be grateful for any information you could offer us .

I am writing because I would like to contribute to offshorelivingletter.com My name is Lucy and I am the Content Editor for a small website which reviews survey sites and how useful they are for businesses. I know you are busy so I wonâ€™t take up too much of your time.

I would like to write an article for offshorelivingletter.com on the subject of building a successful home-based business. For the last 7 years I have used my knowledge of HR and business development and set up my own company. I now work from home and itâ€™s given me more freedom and flexibility. I would now like to pass on my knowledge to others as I believe the future of many great products and services are being created in our spare rooms at the kitchen counter and in the garage. Iâ€™m more than happy to tailor this article toward your specifications and ideas. Would this be of interest to you?

The reason that I am approaching you is because having read  http://www.offshorelivingletter.com/key-topics/tax-havens/ I felt this would be something you would like to cover. Iâ€™m happy for you to review the article I write for you. This article will contain some references such as to news articles studies and papers but also to the site I work with which provides reviews of survey websites.

Please let me know if we can work together.

Best Regards

Thank you for taking me back to memory lane!
I love your post on Santiago particularly on Barrio Italia.
I have the feeling we lived a few blocks from each other during your sporadic stay. 

If I may I'd like to add that although you believe there's nothing to Italy to the neighborhood there always was. Just a few blocks from the furniture site or carpenters of the trade and within ""the Vintage Italia"" area you will find ""la Capilla Italiana"" mass in Spanish with an Italian accent. In fact a few more blocks north East of your sited pictures you will also find the Embassy of Italy. Providencia was founded by a few Italian families in the early 1900's I'm the third generation.
Like this district or Comuna sister cities were founded by a different Ethinic background: Spaniards South of Providencia Arabics So. East Palestineans & Israleans North East Turkish North. In its majority young couples and immigrant children of II WW and even along the south highway European Gypsies have their Barrio in Las Cisternas.
In these older neighborhoods you can appreciate their influence as you find ornate designs on homes gates doors statues home layouts with service quarters court yards and grape vine gazebos...Oh my God I'm getting home sick!! Thanks for these memories..
Hope to see you around!!
Monica :)

I am a U.S. resident and would like advise for taxes on worldwide assets. My parents who lived in Honduras (Central America) passed away in the last 2 years. I will soon begin receiving yearly dividends from a Holding company in Honduras. My father (a French citizen) did not leave a will. He had an account in Switzerland that will be divided among his children.  2)My parents also owned an apartment (in Miami) which is under a Panamanian company.  Looking for a Panama attorney that can advise us on how to update Panama corporation since most officers have passed away (my parents were president/vice president) only my brother remains as the director of the company.

Why hasnâ€™t Live and Invest Overseas reported on the terrible drought and wildfires that have swept Portugal these past several months. 
It is *the* single most reason that I switched my decision to travel first in looking for a new overseas home from Portugal to Mexico last July. 
I could never impose my personal needs - even a glass of water - on any country at such a time.
I may well travel to Portugal later when it resumes raining
Meanwhile i have much enjoyed my first two weeks in San Miguel de Allende.

I got my Permanent Residency card from Panama via the Friendly Nations Visa route but I did not get the cedula. What is involved with converting or upgrading it to a cedula? Is it worth it? Is there a time limit? I tried using my residency card for discounts and it worked at some places but not others. If all it takes is another 3 day trip down (I'm still working full-time in the US for another 3 -4 years) I'll do it but I can't spare another 2 week trip down for quite a while.

Thank you.

I am a 57-year-old South African born American citizen.  I have been receiving yours and Kathleenâ€™s newsletter for the past 8 months and realise that you both have great wisdom and many yearsâ€™ experience in dealing with some of the issues now confronting my American -born wife and me. 
 I have been a US citizen since 1989. Eight years ago we moved back to South Africa with the idea of giving back and helping with many of the social problems here in the country.  For six years until the end of last year we ran an orphanage for 50 children â€“ a wonderful and utterly exhausting season of our lives. Due to my wifeâ€™s health we have had to step out of that role and for the first time in 8 years I have picked up my head and am trying to make sense of the legal/tax world around us.  
Without overly complicating the story I need some advice in regard to a South African Family Trust started by my recently deceased father and for which I have not been but am now a potential beneficiary.  I am faced with a few watershed decisions.  I would hope if I outlined my specific questions in an e-mail a 15 to 30-minute Skype consult would suffice to get the guidance I need.  I gather from your newsletters that this a service you do offer and would love to know how much it would cost me and if possible how soon could we talk? 
We would greatly appreciate it if we were able to tap into your great wisdom and experience and look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards

Hi Lief 
My wife and I are senior citizens keen on retiring in France (buying an apartment in France and living in it). On a visit to scout properties in France last month a real estate agent advised that we could save a lot of money later on if we added my wife's daughter as co-owner of the apartment. She is unmarried and lives here in USA. (I have no children).  Any comments/advice would be helpful.
Thanks!

103314,70,bryan Short,burrhusk@gmail.com,5704684527,,,"My partner and I have done a great deal of traveling over the years and had decided to retire in puerto vallarta Mexico;  Until we experienced cartegena.  Now at the ages of 45 and 48 after both serving in careers as commercial real estate developers and construction contractors.  We would love to find a colonial style multi-story home in the old town section of cartegena with a courtyard which needs a great deal of restoration even to the point of being a crumbling building in need of gutting the worse off the better for two reasons;  allows us to be much more creative in our restoration and we are hoping for a cash sale between $45000 and $100000 and realize the worse the wear the better to asking price.  We would like to spend retirement after restoration of whatever property we purchase hosting other couples and like-minded travelors in our cartegena home requiring 4-6 extra bedrooms (besides our master suite) and  a big plus would be a courtyard so common in the colonial style cartegena home.  Although we had hoped to be inside the wall we understand we may be much luckier in meeting our needs by looking at other areas within the city such as Getsameni which of course we would be readily to consider.  Really we will seriously consider any and all buildings meeting our needs regardless of their area.  Please give us any advise you feel may be of assistance.

There will be a capital gain on it but in Canada we do not pay capital gain taxes...what you make from the sale you get to keep.  How is this going to work for me in the states?  Will I have to report a gain on my foreign owned principle residence as a citizen of that country?

I had colon cancer years ago and am afraid with Trumpcare it might be difficult for me to get health insurance in the near future.  I have an option to move to UK...but would rather have an option to live in continental Europe.  I have been looking at Portugal but don't have enough funds to buy a property to qualify for citizenship by investment.  Is it possible to move to Portugal and become a permanent resident then eventually get a citizenship w/o investing?  If yes what are the requirements in terms of residency time and timeline to apply for the citizenship and the income requirement for a couple?  We are 61 and 56 years old.
Another question is my husband's grandfather came from Croatia and we looked while in Croatia last year if we could get a copy of his birth or baptism certificate but failed because of Croatia's complicated history and border issues.  We are thinking of hiring a professional ancestry expert.  My husband and our daughter would be able to get a Croatian thus European citizenship if we can provide such documents and pass a written test.

103343,156,David,daveetch@gmail.com,,,USA,"Lee great piece on ""Fixer-Uppers"".  However I have a question regarding a totally different subject...taxes...more specifically taxes on ""world"" income (Social Security pension etc). Seems like nobody ever talks about this.  If I understand correctly if an American is a resident of Mexico or Colombia those governments will assess income tax on the American's retirement income that comes from the US. Do you have experience in this matter?

I know that Ecuador does NOT assess income tax on the Expat's world income.  Wouldn't this seem to put Ecuador clearly in first position as the best place to retire to avoid being double taxed on retirement income?

Colombia has no tax treaty with the US so obviously the American is going to get taxed by both Uncle Sam and Tito Pablo (double taxation).  It seems like a no-brainer that the American should stay away from Colombia.

Mexico has a tax treaty with the US but the details are extremely confusing and no doubt both are going to steal a chunk of your income.

My sights are still on Ecuador.  However I've spent time in Mexico and Colombia and they both have some nice qualities.  But bottom line I think he who does not tax my world income gets my vote as the place I want to live invest and enjoy my retirement.  What are your thoughts regarding income taxes to Mexico and Colombia?   ",2017-11-09,,

Over the years just by reading live & invest overseas letter I have developed a keen interest & deep respect for your assessment & opinion. The return you have mentioned on your initial investment to your current assessed value of the overseas property is truly remarkable. Though  you mentioned â€œlevered â€œ in your calculations with due respect I may say a levered S&P 500 would also produce much higher return. Argument against a levered S&P position is fully understandable. Congratulations on your monumental success. I look forward to attending one your sponsored live & invest overseas meetings in near future. Thanks for your newsletter & all the information you bring to your readers.
Hasan

I read your $5K --> $1.2M with some interest. Just wondering if you really would have been stupid enough to put $50K in an index fund and never touched it again for 2 decades?

My stock market investments are up over 80% this year alone. I pick individual companies to invest in. I abhor mutual funds index funds and ETFs.

Need I explain why? I hope you understand that an S&P index fund is guaranteed to deliver mediocre results. The same can be said for virtually all mutual funds except that you get to pay dearly for the mediocre results. ETFs are slightly better but again you are harnessed with a mix of unequally performing equities.

A limited number of strategically picked companies will out-perform real estate on a regular basis requires far less management expense and energy as well as providing far greater liquidity.

I guess you have to say whatever is necessary to enhance your business. That's only natural but you shouldn't do it via ludicrous comparisons. You chose your investment properties with great care why would you be entirely nonchalant and careless with stock market investments? That's the entire basis for your comparison.",2017-11-13,,offshore-site-contact-form

I'm working with a startup in California as a programmer
I need a place my boat can be without a huge import duty
I'd like to shelter (legally) as much of my income from taxes as possible.
My thoughts are to create a company in Panama that is paid by the California company
The Panamanian company will then pay me.  This should shelter the first $100K/year because I'm a resident in Panama and working for a foreign company.
I don't know what this means in terms of Panamanian taxes though.

Currently:
In Grand Cayman working for a Cayman company that pays me $185K/year.  I get the first $100K tax free and the income tax on this island is $0

I will own 30% of the California startup over the next 3 years (vesting).

I was previously in touch with a gentleman who had some great beach front lots south of Fortaleza.  Unfortunately I was not ready to buy at that time.  I'm seriously interested and depending upon timing of income from my investments would like to check this out.  I already have RE investments in Brazil.   MAin interest is - where - price - specifics of the property.  Th ACTUAL highway - roads that get you to the lots.  Price of lot alone.  paved streets - sewerage (septic ?) - water table (I'm assuming well water) - electrical access.  If this os goin gout in stages I am looking for a nice lot and house.   So it may be more advantageous for me to plan on a purchase within the next 12 months +.  I saw some little lots in a development that are stacked next to each other.  Not acceptable.
Based on the artists rendition of the development this may be the same place as the 1st lots I looked at.  They we about 30-50 + feet of actual beach front and there was a restaurant/hotel being planned nearby etc.

Anyway... as much detail as possible if this is the same developer.  I understood that all the old lots were gone so I figured I'd better look elsewhere.  You have my phone # above if we can catch a time to discuss once I've looked over the prospectus for your property.   (I already get the overseas property alert)  Thanks ...

The houses have no heat and it feels pretty damp and cold.  Medellin: is known as the city of the Eternal Spring.  Temperatures year-around are 75 degrees and flowers everywhere.  And it is a short flight from Bogota the capital of Colombia and a truly sophisticated multi-cultural cinematheques museums theater hub.   Bogotanos are known for the politeness and refined manners.  Medelling is also a short flight to Cartagena Santamarta and Guajira great Caribbean spots.  By the way  gringos tend to think that European culture is found just int he South of South America.  Pretry mistaken: Germans and Lithuanians arrived in Colombia in the 1800's.   The Cafe region has a large Lithuanian diaspora from the 1800's.  We also have a pretty good Italian Lebanese and Turkish diaspora.  Colombia is a multicultural country where all the immigrants assimilated and brought a unique cultural flavor.,2017-12-04,,mailbag-2018

I enjoy your articles on real estate in many countries ... I have been thinking of moving to Mexico but to many I had written ..some wrote back local water is a big issue. At home one can use bottled water but eating outside is a very different matter and some I know got very sick on vacation in Mexico.
A couple had mentioned to wash fruts vegetables with iodine before consuming it. It seems that water is a big problem in Mexico. Not just one area but looks like most of Mexico. 

Any comments on this issue will be much appreciated.

104210,376,Al,maggiesfriends1@gmail.com,,,U.S.,"Sorry you are out of touch. $30 an hour sounds like a lot until you remove taxes business insurance licenses etc. 
I have known many people that are trying to raise families on much much less than that. 
There is a cycle that hits when you are poor. When something breaks you replace it with the cheapest possible model because you really don't even have money for that. Then that item breaks because it was substandard. You drive old cars and they break constantly. There are always expenses from the public schools if you have kids.  Prices have gone up on everything but your wages are stagnate because of 13 million undocumented workers that keep wages low and business being run out of the country. The ability to save is NOT there. Most of the time break even looks great. 
I have lived close to that but have many friends in that position. Yes most have a 6 pack a day. Does the upper class really think saving that little will help them in the long run?
I now have a fiance and friends that are in the $500K a year range. We talk about the lower classes and it is amazing. They have no idea that there was no ability for collage. They blame them for being lazy. I explain the truth and they begin to somewhat get it but the disparity is so great that they really can't comprehend it.  Our country does not have the opportunity that it did.  And I fear that it won't come back.",2017-12-09,,
104211,376,Paul E,52bullets@gmail.com,,,USA,"You asked if you were out of touch with the plight of ordinary people who seem to make a fair wage but have nothing but a roof a car and some tools after a couple of setbacks.
 The short answer to that question is yes!! I understand the situation you described for your handyman as I could have easily been in the same predicament if not for a few lucky breaks.
 I was an ordinary guy making a good wage and raising a family. When I was young my father beat me up about saving money every chance he had. He had no education didn't trust banks and only invested in his employers (PT+T) stock and retirement program. He thought he had provided enough for my mother so if he died she would be OK.  Unfortunately he died at 52 and my mother lived another 14 years. What seemed like a lot of money at the time he died didn't make it 7 years. Most financial advisors aren't on pay for performance rules so don't have a motivation to make your money last forever. Hers was no exception. When her money pile started getting small he had her sell her telephone stock and use that till it was gone. Of course he took a share of her total every year till it was too small to interest him. Then she had to turn to me for help. I was struggling with a young family and helping her was killing our budget. It only takes a couple of minor medical problems to find out that insurance and medicare don't pay enough and your savings is suddenly gone. Yes doctors and hospitals are in it for the money not your well being.
 Non the less I was saving but knew little about investing. The company investment adviser didn't exactly steer me to the right types of investments and they went way down during the 98 crash. It was only then that I realized I would have to learn about investing on my own and started making money off my money. It was a good thing too as my employer tried to cut me off early to save having to fund my retirement. Fortunately I had learned and made enough by then to go to the retirement board and buy what they were trying to screw me out of. (Had to right a $104000.00 check) but I had it and got my money. A few other lucky investments and I live well now. Not the case for most people I know. Even the ones who made way more that me. I still see ads every day from investment gurus who claim they will show you how to turn a few thousand into a fortune and they guarantee it.. Ha Ha. That guarantee is no good if all you get is a free year of a system that didn't work in the first place. So the average guy is afraid to invest and sorting the liars and cheats from the very small number of honest investing gurus is next to impossible without losing a substantial amount of money. We need someone who will try these guys out and rate them honestly. Then maybe the shysters will get out and the honest guys will offer a real deal based on what you profit from their advise instead of what they can get you to pay up front or the total you have them handling.. I always thought pay for performance was the only way to go. The word would get around to the average folks in very little time. It's a win win for everyone but the crooks..

I thought this might be some way of using a provocation to get an email address and name. Nevertheless despite what the intent of this email might be I must respond. Yes yes yes! You are so out of touch with the reality of many good people. The inferences in your thinking are disturbing. You infer a ""blame the victim ""mentality. Someone must have done something wrong to be in this position in the United States of America. Your handyman did not do something he was supposed to do that left him this vulnerable. Perhaps back in the 1950s your thinking would have been more realistic. A family could get by on a 1 income provider. If you worked you would be provided for by your employer. There was a social safety net which has been ripped away and they still continue to rip. So the man worked for you for a decade. But you gave him no benefits only an hourly wage. I am a 62 year old clinical social worker who has just retired after 30+ years serving in New York City. My retirement circumstances are better than most .However I still cannot have the life that I want. I have been very financially responsible and I have balanced that with being as financially generous as I could. You may have both a gift and a developed skill at managing money. This man had skills in other areas but may not have had your gifts. Alternately he may have given his resources to his family first such as educating children and grandchildren. I don't know. I don't know him. But your question with its slim chance of being genuine hits at one of the fundamental problems with financial inequality in this country. For God sake wake up!",2017-12-09,,

I always recive your and other LIOS publications. I've never acted in any of your investment suggestions just because I have no money to invest.
I just got my permanent residence here in Mexico with working/business permit but it took me 4 years and I spent all of my savings (plus some help from my family in Italy) in the process. It might have been worth the price of one of your conferences before launching my overseas adventure!
Long story short: I live in Mexico City legal permanent resident  I'm licenced professional cook and have a hotel management degree as well. I'm working from home now mainly making home made pasta and few more dishes for an hotel and private customers that I deliver personally. I want to expand my horizons and looking for a partner investor to make a legitimate ""home made"" pasta shop. There are already few here in Mexico City and they are doing well as far as I know.
I'm now working underground mainly because I was only allowed working as employee with my temporary visa but since I got the permanent a week ago I now can make a business with no minimum investment requirements just as a Mexican. 
You already understood I know it's unusual - you rather give investment advices than taking from strangers - But yet here I am. You don't know me at all but I took confidence in you Kathleen and Lief over the years. I need someone living in Mexico at least part of the year as you do. Someone willing to invest between 100 and 200k pesos depending mainly on the location and size of the business. I think you don't like Mexico City but we are talking business here and Mazatlan is not that far if you are anyhow Interested (it would surprise me but I give a shot) you should pay me a visit. I'm not good with formal business plan but I have already make some research both legal and money wise. Just contact me if you will at
giacomocosta1972@libero.it
 or 5516930664.
Thank you for your time anyways

104321,376,Robert Odynski,robo@robsonthermal.com,,,Canada,"You are right Mr. Karim but I think the root of the problem is the electoral system. 

All countries with competing political parties and democratic elections end up with politicians catering to the lowest common denominator. They have to do things to stay in power regardless of the harm done to everyone's future. Most voters just want to hear sweet nothings and get some 'free stuff' asap. The vast majority have no idea what the consequences might be and don't want to know about such things anyway. 

The solution is to pre-qualify voters based on their knowledge of what has to be done to create a good economy and good standard of living for everyone. So a lot of people will lose their right to vote. But pre-qualified voters will vote for politicians who will do what's best and everyone will benefit. 

Unfortunately for your country and mine this would never get support from politicians the media lobbyists and others who have a vested interest in maintaining the staus quo. So nothing will change.",2017-12-11,,

The same goes for Healthcare the ACA is anything but affordable. It was basically a government takeover of 20% of our economy. I am lucky(maybe) as I am on Tricare the military version of government run healthcare. My military training was great but the economy wants paper not experience in the work environment.

I couldnâ€™t agree with you more regarding health care.  Business and special interests are competing for every dollar spent on health care and along with the cost of liability insurance for our lawyers making it less and less affordable.  I wonder how we reached the point where businesses large and small are responsible for paying for our health insurance.  I believe the best (however unlikely) solution is a basic single payer system where everyone is guaranteed a basic level of health care.  Supplemental insurance should be available for those who choose.

That may not be the ideal answer to our health care woes but we need to do something to address the current situation.

Sincerely
Craig",2017-12-12,,

104367,94,Amod Lokre,amodlokre@gmail.com,,,,"Hi Kathleen! Hope you are doing well.

I am a Canadian citizen currently living in Edmonton Canada and working as a Financial Advisor at a large bank here. 

I have been dreaming of escaping from the harsh North American winters for the last several years and finally decided to act on it this year.

So I did a lot of online research on this topic (including reading several of your reports!) over the years and finally applied for Permanent Residency in Panama this summer.

I am happy to inform you that my Panamian Permanent Residency has been approved and I will be visiting Panama next month to complete the paperwork.

During my visit I would like to meet with you and Lief if possible. I would like to hear your thoughts about current opportunities in Panama and current opportunities at your company. Also I want to discuss a unique collaborative business proposal which would fit in very nicely in your current business model and help you generate a brand new revenue stream every year.

Can you please let me know if you would like to meet sometime between January 8th to January 18th? I will be in Panama for those 2 weeks and my hotel is in the El Cangrejo neighborhood... so it will be easy for me to come and meet you at your office.

I am including a link to my LinkedIn profile here...
https://ca.linkedin.com/in/amod-lokre-34680838

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks

Amod

P.S. I have sent this message to your Editorial@liveandinvestoverseas.com email also. Looking forward to connecting with you soon. Thanks Amod",2017-12-13,,mailbag-2018

I like your articles about Mazatlan Mexico properties but where to buy properties in the European version of Mazatlan in Europe? 

I'd like to buy a property in Europe with GREAT weather in the Summer time. I'd like to split my time between Europe (Summer) and Mexico (Winter). 

Are there any European countries we can buy those properties like the deals you reported about Mazatlan and also easily get a residency card? 

Maybe in tier 2 or tier 3 European countries that most people don't talk about or know about like Serbia Croatia Montenegro Bulgaria Hungary or Slovenia?    

Thank you!

I just got back from Portugal as I considered moving there - fell in love with the country and the people  but it is just too far from my loved ones. So it is back to Mexico.  I have owned condos in Manzanillo and Puerto Penasco but believe that Mazatlan might be more my style because it is a city and should have more to offer than small towns.  I am scheduled for a trip to Mazatlan in February - could you please suggest a real estate agent or company that I can contact ahead of time to book an appointment.  
Also which area S of San Diego would you recommend?  I live in Scottsdale so both Mazatlan and S of San Diego could easily be reached in case there are emergencies that need me to get back to AZ quickly. Many thanks for your assistance. Feliz Navidad.",2017-12-19,,

104583,156,Shannon Smith ,shannons2015@icloud.com,,,Mexico (via US),"Re the 12/19 Letter to the Editor from the gentlemen commenting on water in Mexico 

I agree there are many places in Mexico where it is better not to drink the water as well as a few where you can.  Also you can install UV and filtration systems. However there are also places in the US (look at Flint or the places where gas drilling has leaked into the water) where it would really be better not to drink the water from a US tap.

 I donâ€™t think however that drinking tap water should normally be the deciding factor. If one can live a better life on the ocean or in a colonial home for $2000/month including maids and gardeners and with better healthcare then I think buying very inexpensive bottled water is a small sacrifice. A â€œgarafonâ€ (water cooler sized 20 liter jug) is $1.15 to $1.40 at the 19 pesos to the dollar exchange rate and they do deliver. 

Also I believe most people in the US should really be washing their vegetables (many which come from Mexico as well as from the US) due to pesticides dirty water and lack of sufficient bathrooms in fields. When we come home with fruits and vegetables we immediately fill a large bowl with water and a few biodynamic drops and soak them before putting them in the fridge. Nothing ever goes in the fridge before doing this so it is all ready to use with no confusion. This simple process is much easier and less time consuming than say having to clean your own house in the US or Canada. ",2017-12-19,,

I'm planning on traveling to a few places you have recommended in Europe in 2018 (Portugal France and possibly Ireland). I would like to spend at least a month in each of these places. Is there a local resource or website (besides 'airbnb') in these three places that has furnished rental properties to consider? I would like to rent a studio or 1 bed for between $500-900. By the way I am semi-retired working on my own projects which have been mostly put 'on hold' until I find a suitable place to move to.

 I would like to thank you for the valuable information and insights you are providing in your website.
recently I watched an interesting video on YouTube for someone sharing his experience in investing in international real estates  a lot of what he said conform with what you already talked about in details in your website however his conclusion about the whole issue was important. 
his conclusion was that he rather invests in stocks than in  international real estate because  it's less of the headache as he said. and it can get much better yield with almost the same risk and has more liquid asset.
I would like to know your opinion on that.

Thank you for including Bali Indonesia on your radar.  If I may I would like to suggest the village of Ubud as a place which is peaceful beautiful and well-equipped for visitors and possibly living full time.  Ubud is already a popular place for romantics with plenty of homestays hotels and nice restaurants but it is the peacefulness that draws me back many times over.  Ubud is very walkable central to other Bali attractions and has a cooler climate without the frenzy and traffic of Sanur.  Admittedly there are fewer options for shopping and healthcare but the surroundings are both breathtaking and relaxing.  Thanks for the opportunity to contribute.",2017-12-29,,mailbag-2018

My wife and I will be retiring to France in 2018. I saw your article on health insurance there. I'm wondering if the 5 yr residence requirement is still in effect? I spoke to someone a few months ago at the French Securite Sociale office and was told that the new law states that a foreigner can buy into the national system after residing in France for only 3 months. The cost should be 8% of your income after the first 9500 euro of income. I know you said you are moving back to Paris so I thought you might be able to confirm this.

What ever happened to Malta as a retirement and investment destination? Five years ago or so Malta was touted as a great place with low taxes a great climate and low prices and it is English speaking. You see I'm just not good with languages. I like Portugal but I'mconcerned it may have peaked as far as prices go for a retirement home and I want to be in Europe and somewhere warm. The recent cold spell in New York is all anyone of my advanced age needs to pack their bags and leave. I hope Malta hasn't sunk into the sea.

Best wishes on your new endeavor. Since you are located in my city of choice I will depend heavily on your expertise.
I've traveled for business and pleasure throughout the world and I'm familiar with Mexico and Argentina in particular. In the last few years my wife and I have toured Peru Panama Costa Rica Chile Colombia and Ecuador (next month) with me having an eye out for property while we traveled. We live in the Chicago 'burbs and I found El Poblado to be a close equal to the Chicago Loop except for the cost of living and far superior to the other cities for various reasons.
Here are my problems in making a decision: 1) Does it really make sense to buy vs rent if I'm not interested in earning income from the property? I've had enough headaches dealing with renters in my downtown Chicago condo. I'd like to take advantage of the currency situation but ...... and (2) I speak Spanish to a limited extent. After spending 2 weeks in Mexico City or Buenos Aires my head hurt from the effort in translating. Will I have the same experience in El Poblado unless I make a strong effort to upgrade my skills? Or are there enough English speakers to give me an occasional respite?
Any guidance you can offer would be appreciated.",2018-01-02,,

I am Stephane Prigent wetland specialist for a German company based in Muscat (Sultanate of Oman). I have a PhD in environmental engineering and I am specialized in the design/execution/operation of ecological technologies (also called constructed wetlands) for the treatment of different types of wastewater.
Beside of my expertise in wastewater treatment I have a great interest with Aquaponic technologies and see its development as a sustainable practice for food security throughout the world. Currently I am having a small aquaponic unit and also practicing trials in the Middle-East desert with treated oil production water (saline water)  for the non-food crop production (Salicornia bigelovii as a oil crop).
 I am looking to invest in agriculture farming in Thai either on a new facility (another farm development in Thai or surrounding countries) or on the extension of an existing facility. Our partnership could also include specific services on wastewater treatment if a potential market is also opened in Thai.
Please let us know each other better and have a discussion on business model to work together in the future.
regards

 Please forward complete details including but not limited to:  Offering Memorandum detailed description of the building materials and type of construction is it Fee Simple ownership? i.e. is the Owner is registered on title?
Are there any resale restrictions?
Explain why as the owner I only get use of the unit 4 weeks per year then I would pay like a renter?  This seems to be interval ownership NOT ownership.  What would be the charges for staying more than 4 weeks per year?
Details of any management agreement for the rental pool and all associated fees (condo strata assessment insurance management etc.)  
Is the Owner required to purchase the ""furniture package"" or can the Owner furnish their own suite?
As the owner is there a lock in management agreement such that the manager can't be changed?

I am originally from Russia but lived in Australia for the past 25 years. Now when both my children are self-sufficient I just want to get out of there!
Always wanted to live in Europe (love the culture) so bought your Europe kit but I have limited budget.
So where can a single woman relocate (and possibly get second citizenship) if I want to have European feel and lots of culture (and possibly beach)without European price tag? Is this possible?
Iâ€™d appreciate your thoughts.
Thank you very much!

It is nearing tax preparation time again and I have a general question for you.  After attending Belize International Living Conference in 2016 my wife and I invested in a Mango farm and in 2017 we invested in a Avocado farm.  We are both citizens of USA.  To date we have no income from either investment but need to know if we need to fill out IRS Form 8938 or any other form for 2017 tax year.

I have nop intention of living there but the banks do offer some 6-8% interest in fixed deposit . Hence I have just parked the money in fixed deposit of varying time frame right now. Any idea how I could get the money out and take it to some other country (other than the USA) to invest and obtain residency ?

The US government prevents US citizens from investing in certain international investments.  Some reasons/regulations given is that only accredited investors are allowed.  I am trying to place small investments in a few new offshore crypto-currencies but these firms will not accept USA residents - no matter what!  They state dealing with the USA government regulators is a hassle & liability they just do not want to  ever deal with.  I am 61 years old and beginning to feel like I am in some kind of prison living here in the USA!!  It also feels like our government has become the local day care center and we are the little tikes.  Is it possible to ""quickly"" set up an offshore residency that is reasonably priced?  
Thank you for your help & advice in advance

The registration process on my lot at Los Islotes (#82) was completed late last year through the Panama Public Registry.  Do I owe real estate taxes on a prorated basis for 2017?  If so how much/at what rate & can the taxes be paid directly to the appropriate agency in Panama or would I need to pay them through my attorney?  Thanks for your help!

You have both US and Irish passports. Why do you still want to get Dominican Republic (DR) citizenship and its passport one of the worst travel documents with only access to about 60+ or so countries visa free? Even if DR get visa waiver to EU in the future as someone informed you your Irish or US passport is good enough to travel to EU still better than the DR one. 

Also if you travel on a DR passport you would lose consular protection from US or Irish government if something happens right?  

Thank you.

 We are in the process of loseing everthing we own due to some unfiled reports with the IRS. They took 67000.00 and now with penalties and interest it will be about 400000.00. So essentially I am finished.  I stll want to move to Panama to live and get citizenship eventually.  I know you have to charge for your information hopefully I can afford to know this one important detail as I have to file a 1040 for 2015 and 2016 within the next week.

What currency will the bank hold your money in the US dollar or Singapore dollar?  What is necesary to open an account?  Do you need to go to Singapore or can you open it on the internet?  What documents are needed?  I find this interesting since Jimmy Rogers and his family I believe has moved himself and his family there.  I think I might feel more comfortably have a bank account in Singapore Dollars than US Dollars considering what Banks can do legally thru the Dodd-Frank Act.    ,2018-01-29,,offshore-site-contact-form

I enquired about opening a Euro account in Singapore and the bank through which I enquired (ANZ) wanted a 150K deposit. Needless to say I did not do that.

Why Singapore and why multi currency? would that not incur  fees when moving from one currency to another?

I live in Perth Western Australia so in the Singapore time zone. It may be a forlorn hope but I would like to become invisible to the ATO (Australian Tax Office).

I am anglicized Dutchman ( from living in London on and off for over 30 years) now retired living the good life in Palma de Mallorca. Spain. Having just recently subscribed to your regular emails mainly homing in on central and South America has prompted me in asking for more information on Columbia in particular Cartagena. I lived with my first wife who was Argentinian in Buenos Aires over 45 years ago and used to go on vacation every year to the more tropical parts of northern areas of South America which included Columbia and the beautiful city of Cartagena. So my question can you supply me information on this beautiful city ( hopefully it still is ) in particular retirement cost of living and also property prices. I read you cannot buy front line sea view properties in Columbia if you are a foreign resident. So again I need more information. 
Needless to say I'm happy to pay for this information perhaps in kit form or otherwise 
Look forward to your reply

Thanks for all of your work.

I am a U.S. citizen with a SDIRA that owns a Belize LLC.  The LLC was established with the aid of a Panama City lawyer (Yolany).  The LLC currently owns Simply Natural agricultural investments in Panama.

I am working with Maria Abreu to establish residency and perhaps citizenship for my wife and me in the Dominican Republic.  I intend to purchase real estate in the DR either personally or through the LLC.  (Iâ€™m over 59Â½ so an IRA distribution would not cause a 10% penalty.)

The Panama investments will be making a distribution soon from a U.S. bank account and annually thereafter.  Although the Belize LLC owns an i-Account (as do I and my wife individually) I would like to open a bank account for the Belize LLC in either Belize the DR or elsewhere.  

I would appreciate your suggestions on which banks may be appropriate in any location you believe may be advantageous.

Best Regards â€”

Thanks for all your great information. I had a question about our medical care coverage dilemma in Spain and was wondering if Portugal has the same requirement.  I'm 80 and my wife is 65.  To my knowledge in order to get residency in Spain you must have health insurance comparable to the Spanish government coverage. Once you have residency then you can sign up for the government medical care. The problem is we have Medicare in the US which obviously doesn't cover us there and the private insurance policies we've looked at are extremely expensive if they are comparable and/or will even consider me at my age. Do you know if Portugal is the same? Are there any other ""work-arounds"" that you have discovered?",2018-02-01,,offshore-site-contact-form

It seemed likely - my DNA test from National Geographic's program shows 88% Jewish Diaspora 12% ""Southern European"" meaning Spanish Portuguese and/or Italian.  

However many refugees from the Inquisition either out of fear of capture or in order to assimilate into their new communities changed their names when they fled to Eastern Europe.  

When I sent all of my available geneology to the Sephardic Union in Israel one of the organizations certifying applicants for these citizenships they told me that none of my ancestors names had Sephardic roots and that as far as they were concerned DNA testing was not considered a reliable way to determine ancestry.     

I'm fluent (read write and speak) in Spanish own property in Spain wrote a book that was translated into Spanish and published in Spain last year and did a concert in Spain last November. I was married to a Spaniard for two years in the 1970s and the book we co-wrote during that time is now being translated by the same publisher that translated and published my book last year.

So I opted for residency in Panama.  I'm happy here but I would love to have residency in Spain as well.

Thank you very much for your invitation to attend for free (FREE18GPS) your Global Property Summit in Panama.  I would love to honor your invitation and on the same trip to check also my Mango Plantation wich I bought from Simply Natural.
 
Unfortunately for me I am going to have a major surgery at the beginning of March and I won't be able to attend.  Is there any possibility to substitute this invitation for another one of your later events (Las Vegas Conference or Medellin - have a condo in Sabaneta - or some other future event)?
 
You might not remember me by name.  I am the Romanian guy living in Los Angeles you answered with great details to my email regarding beach front lot at Reserva da Praia Brasil and later at Panama City Marriott you told me that I was very lucky you answered my email.  Then outside the Conference Room we chatted you telling me that you also have 2 citizenships and me telling you that I bought also a condo in Cotacachi and one in Istanbul.  I am following your advice don't I?
 
Dear Lief thank you again for FREE18GPS.  Too bad I can't attend.  And thank you very very much for your intelligent and balanced information regarding overseas life and investments.

107181,94,Lidiia K,lidiiakay@gmail.com,,,,"Hi Kathleen

Just wondering about Algarve - you call this place â€œthe best retirement spot in Europeâ€;- but what if a person wants more than just beach golf food and shops?
I have 7 years before my pension age -but I want to â€œunretireâ€ at the end of this year. 
Iâ€™m interested in arts culture music - clearly I wonâ€™t get that in Algarve....
What place would you suggest for me?
I will be on a budget...

Thank you

I hope you are well.
I attended the Carvoeiro conference in 2016 and it was great )) thx. 
2 important questions please for you now :
1) how do Portugal authorities (and banks in Portugal local or intl branches) treat crypto ?currencies: 1st do they consider it as ""capital "" assets (or ""other assets"" which are untaxed ?) and capital gains for trading gains and how is it taxed (for transfer of some past profits if NHR regime requested in same year and after for trading once NHR is obtained) ? 2nd do banks accept FIAT from crypto exchanges ?
2) for getting a 2nd passport for Sepharadic ancesters reasons for a EU citizen  is there any impact (tax wise rights wise) for a NHR status vs not having this Portuguese passport and having NHR status ?
Thank you very much for yr help

Been following your emails for years and getting closer to retirement where I can do something.
I am very interested in the Algarve region of Portugal and will actually be there but not until the month AFTER your presentation. Too bad. But I will be visiting Faro and Lagos so was curious if I could somehow get direction from you as to where to visit for your recommended rental area for expats and areas to eat etc. for a day or so? I wanted to get a feel for the area and see the place(s) for myself. I will have my family in tow as well.

We enjoyed some of our time in Corozal and I've read with great interest Marie Peay's comments from time to time.  When I saw this article from her moving to Chetumal I was wondering if she would be sending in reports from there from time to time?
If so when might this be?  Does she have an email address that you can share where we could ask questions about that city and area?  The reason being general interest and one more specific about the medical care available there which seems to be more advanced than Corozal area and should one need medical help in this over 70's era it would be great to have someone in the area who can share the knowledge with us

I know you have to pay the bills. So why not be honest about it? Give your subscribers a choice: ads or no ads. Subscribers who want the ads get the newsletter for free and those who don't want them pay some nominal amount. Then everyone's happy. Of course then there's the matter of scope. I live in Vietnam and I don't believe I've ever seen an issue that dealt with property investments in Asia. Right? Right. Your newsletter is worthless to me.

I have met Lillian and Alan and communicated with them by email which is my preferred choice of communication due to severe hearing loss and never had a problem. The lack of response is somewhat disconcerting.
 
In the last couple of days I have written to everyone at Simply Natural...Alan Lilian and Daniela and also the info address and haven't gotten any responses. The last communication was about the dividend a few weeks ago. If you know anything or have someone I can contact w/o making a phone call please let me know.
 
I realize this is unusual and not your business but I appreciate your help.

Iâ€™ve been a subscriber for quite awhile now have attended several conferences and always enjoy reading the material you publish. 

I recently read an Overseas Retirement piece on Santander Spain written by Lucy Culpepper. I am planning to move to northern Spain within the next few months. In the section about residencies and visas she says that although some people do it all on their own you might need to get some help. However she doesnâ€™t say where to get this help! Iâ€™m assuming she means an immigration attorney but would that be stateside or in Spain? And can you or she give some contact information for some good attorneys? In the Rolodex the only attorney listed is for real estate. Thank you so much.

Iâ€™m assuming she means an immigration attorney but would that be stateside or in Spain? And can you or she give some contact information for some good attorneys? In the Rolodex the only attorney listed is for real estate. Thank you so much.

This is not a question about property.  Could you kindly tell me if you know of a person called Cliff Goodrich.  He took 20000 dollars from my mother and myself to invest in property in Belize and then disappeared. I believe he resides in Florida.  Please do not print this question Lief and  I understand that you may not get back to me as this is nothing to do with overseas property.  It is just the fact that we have been ripped off and cannot do anything about this.  We signed contracts and sent the money over but have not heard from him for about three years.  The last name of the property was ""The Haven"" and it was to be close to Deep River in Belize.  My mom is now 87 years old  and was looking forward to spending time in Belize at this dream place.

107872,376,Jeff,jeffschindler777@gmail.com,,,USA,"Dear Karim Rahemtulla

I just read your article ""Did The New Tax Bill Shrink Your Piggy Bank?""  I agree  with all you said about being responsible and paying your debt.  I do have one disagreement that you might want to think about.  I think if mortgage interest is deductible then HELOC should be too.  If I were to sell my house and rent for a few months I could take equity from my current residence and pay off a car loan.  A responsible thing to do.  Then when I buy a new house I can deduct the interest and I have no car debt.  In a way this is no different than using a HELOC to pay off the car.  The previous law did allow for this sort of responsible debt management by not penalizing folks who try to keep debt to a minimum and pay extra on the house (developing equity) rather than buying that newer car before they needed to.  It actually incentivized responsible money-smart folks like us to get extra equity in our house rather than save excessively for a rainy day fund.  It did not just allow any interest to be deductible the total of the loans could not exceed the value of the house.  It was actually fair and logical. (You will never hear me say that again about the federal government.)  It might literally be the only logical thing they have done in 50 years and now even that is gone. LOL

Anyways I thought you might find my take on it interesting.  Good article.

My name is Ron Buice and I am a retired former USAF veteran.  Several years ago my wife and I purchased anexisting franchise for a company called Cookie Bouquet. It is still operating70 of its original franchise group starting in Plano Texas (where I own a rental home).  We only owned the franchise for two years and sold it for nice profit 
Subsequently we bought a window treatment shop in Jupiter FL. We sold the CB franchise because of restricted geograpic sales area and limited products. The number of shops reached 275 until about 10 years ago due to mismanagement and refusing to allow franchisees to expand the products needed and refusal to allow franchisees to adapt their franchise for changing demographics.
Anyway I want to introduce a new and unique business of that franchise in Panama City.  I retained a complete set of the franchise manuals and I am no longer prohibited (ND/NC from doing the same as I did in my original franchise of ND/NC. I have modified the business model which provides products from several other franchises and rearranged the venue to eliminate the majority of the physical marketing provisions of the franchise.
Understand that my business model has no relationship to Cookie Bouquet Company (now Cookies By design). I am NOT selling a franchise but may possibly offer franchises in the future of my new unique business model.
My business model eliminates the costly construction and fit-out and utilizes all the original baking decorating and assembly of Theme-based cookie arrangement.  Arrangements (Bouquets) are delivered from the production location (small rented facility) PLUS displays and counter sales of 5-6 bouquets from rented kiosks in megamalls like Multicentro and Albrooks.
Stand alone walkin shops are not necessary since the sales are made/taken over-the-counter gourmet cookies and roasted/glazed nuts and Bouquets are on permanent kiosk display.  Many bouquets sales are over the phone but most will occur at the display/kiosk site in the mall.
I need to locate an entrepreneural person who wants their own very profitable business for under a $30K investment Since there are minimal buildout and startup can be days as compared to months in normal franchise like Mrs. FieldsNutty Bavarion and Candy Bouquets plus a couple of othere as desired.
It is a very simple business and does not require any ""cooking"".  Actually the only customizing work at the kiosko is icing writing on the pre-baked 13 inch chocolate chip pan cookies in the kiosk for a small up-charge i.e. Happy BirthdayPeg"". Walkup customers can order at the kiosk which are produced at and delivered from the off-street production facility.
I hope this is clear enough to see how unique this business.  Also remember the market for these products and services are familiar with most American women from having send/received these kinds of edible gift products.  The franchises have never been offered outside the US.  It should be a no-brainer and very popular and profitable there.
What would you do if you were me and seeking a majority owner Panamanian resident.
This is the first step in my quest for future residence in Panama.
FYI Gordon Haas was considering this business before he sold his restaurant and moved away.
I have signed up for the Living and Investing in Panama and hope to come there within the next couple of months so any assistance you can provide will be appreciated.  I plan to  furnish about $10K of equipment to the enterprise and desire only 15-20% ownership of the business. My email address is ron_buice@yahoo.com and tel # is 972-836-2382.
All the best Ron

I have a self-directed Roth IRA account with a custodian bank.  I have read that some investments can be invested with a self-directed IRA (Roth or Regular) custodian account funds.  If my current custodian bank won't allow the foreign investment of my Roth IRA funds what bank do you suggest that I use 1035 exchange to transfer to the bank that can invest my Roth IRA funds ?
I would greatly appreciate your response on at least one of the investments you have written about.
Thank you very much.

108229,356,Anja Brito,anja.kabrito@gmail.com,1-289-644-2490,,,"Hi Lief 
I know you are getting ready for your Panama conference but my sights are set pretty firmly on Europe... My ageing parents live in Germany (near the Frankfurt airport) and I want to be within an easy flight (or even driving distance) from them so I am contemplating an investment property (and future part- or full-time residence) in the Old World. I love the Lake Garda area but bargains are hard to find... In terms of bang for your buck the costal regions of southern Spain stand out. And I know you guys are fans of the Algarve but prices are so much higher there. The grand plan would be to initially only spend limited amounts of time in Europe (off-season) and rent the property out on a short-term rental basis most of the time. Which of these areas would - in your opinion and experience - give me the best return on investment considering acquisition price carrying costs (including property management) and rental potential (and potentially also future appreciation). I am also open to other suggestions (including southern France) as long as it is within an hours' drive from an airport with an easy (and low cost) plane connection to Frankfurt or Hahn or within a 12 hour drive to Frankfurt. 
So to make a long question short: where do I get the biggest bang for my buck for an investment property in Europe today. I need at least 2 bedrooms and my absolut maximum budget is EUR 220000 (but I would also be happy to spend less...).
Cheers and looking forward to your answer!!!

I know that your advice is normally for American citizens but maybe you can help an Australian?
I'm nearly 60 and not eligible for Australian pension for another 6 years however I don't want to continue working just to scrape by.
If I sell my house - where would you suggest be a best place for a single woman to 'retire"" and get a second passport? I'm thinking Portugal as you suggested and I love Europe -but will I get an Australian pension there after 6 years?
Apparently Americans can? As I always read how one can retire just on Social Security?

Thank you very much really appreciate it if you could clarify it for me!

108417,94,michael wall,newpeach@aol.com,,,,  Question  I was contacted about a potential agri partnership investment last year from a UK Group who does these things. I believe he got my contact info from your outfit / or Lief. It was An Oregon USA blueberry deal they were doing. They actually did 2 projects there.  I decided not to do that as the big payout and buyout came 20 years later. I felt that was too long and I might not live to see it. Now they are doing another one with Pineapples in Costa Rica. Payoffs are year by year and start much sooner. My question is is there a reason they are not mentioned in your promo emails that often come or did they just buy a list of names?  Im not even sure if they have sold all positions but was considering doing it. If I do it the amount would be 40K. Just asking as its hard to do homework or check up on something like this when they are foreign without a huge record.  Their website is found here http://agripartnership.com/,2018-03-04,,mailbag-2018

I am living in Thailand and married a Thai woman with a 15-year-old daughter in 2017. Neither of them has ever been in the U.S.


I recently found out that I can get an ITIN for my wife but cannot get one for my stepdaughter because she has never been in the U.S. That means I cannot claim my stepdaughter as a dependent for tax purposes.


My question is: if I cannot claim my stepdaughter as a dependent does that mean we do not have to report under the FBAR any cumulative assets she has over $10000 to the IRS?

I'd potentially be interested already having a connection to Brazil that I would like to increase with the appropriate investment.
I have a couple of questions to start.
First what would be the monthly condominium charge and what does that include especially pertaining to the sports and other leisure facilities on the complex applying mainly to the golf club but also to any others.
If any what are the additional annual or monthly or per-use costs of these facilities?
Secondly what is the situation for owner use of the property when not occupied by short- or other-term renters? Is there pooling of the units under the same manager so that owners always have cost -free access to any unused properties in that portfolio whether their particular unit is occupied?

I have been reading your newsletters for some time now and was particular interested in your recent one regarding the DR. I have visited the DR last year and am interested in investing there. After reading your newsletter I was also interested in the residency by investment option. As I will be unable to attend your DR conference I was wondering whether you are able to share your list of recommended lawyers who could assist in the investment property purchase as well as fast track residency through the investment. I'm also curious as to your current recommended options for investment in the DR. Thank you.",2018-03-10,,offshore-site-contact-form

108883,94,Martijn Goris,martijn@kokomomedia.nl,,,,"Hello Kathleen

Sorry for sending this message trough different canals I jsut really want it to come trough!

My name is Martijn Goris and Iâ€™m a producer and researcher for a Dutch documentary TV show called: â€˜Floortje naar het einde van the wereldâ€™. For this show the host Floortje travels all over the world to meet and portray people who have made the choice to go and live in really remote areas and who have a special story to go with it. (more info: programma.bnnvara.nl/floortje/english)

I was doing some research because we would love to visit the Paraguay Bolivia Northern Argentina region for our upcoming season and when I started reading articles I came across your name very often. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m writing you this e-mail right now. There are a lot of really remote hard to reach and thinly populated areas there just how we love them for our show. Regions like the Paraguayan Chaco for instance weâ€™d love to visit. But to do so we would have to find someone to portray.

Hereâ€™s where i hope you can maybe help us out do you happen to know or know of someone a duo or a family who moved over there from western society (whom speak English (or Dutch)) and who now lives in such an area and has a special story for us to portray too? If so Iâ€™d love to get in touch with them to see if we can visit them for our show. Mind you this doesn't have to be in any of the places I just mentioned it could be anywhere remote since I read that you have travelled a lot! Itâ€™s just that these regions I have been searching in would be a really good fit for our show.

Anyway I hope you can find the time to help us out a little! Iâ€™d love to hear from you soon!

All the best

I am a Canadian citizen my husband is an American citizen.  I just turned 60 and have lived in the U.S. for 40 years with a ""Green Card"" status.   As this point it seems to make sense to become a dual citizen which means my 2nd passport would be a U.S. passport.  This would make my legal status here in the U.S. more secure.  In the event then that we wanted to re-locate out of the U.S. for whatever reason it might be to Canada.  Should that happen as a U.S. Citizen there would be no limit on how long I could be away from the U.S.  But if I remained a green card holder I could not leave the U.S. indefinitely without risking my green card holder status.  Although this is not exactly the 2nd passport I had originally envisioned or what you write about I believe it is a good next step.

In light of current temperatures here and up north what do you think about Canada?  
I welcome your fresh perspective and appreciate all comments you are willing to share.

What do you think about the real estate market in Batumi Georgia?

The prices are very low and it seems to be a great deal but I am afraid that the supply will outgrow the demand even though the number of tourist in Georgia is steadily increasing. So do you know whether it makes sense to buy such a cheap apartment as an investment property?

109004,395,Donald,dondyer31@gmail.com,3178849820,Late-Afternoon to Early-Evening,United States,"I am interested in attending the conference.  I think I could learn a lot of new information about starting a part of my life overseas in a new location country city culture etc.  I am definitely going to do this and plan to do it sooner rather than later; therefore these kinds of educational experiences are perfect for me now that I have finally made the decision to begin the process of living overseas.  

My plan is to find a place to spend the winter months (aka snowbird) beginning around DEC or JAN each year and staying in my Chosen location until approximately April or May each year; thus returning back home to the USA (Indianapolis IN) when Spring has sprung and the warmer weather longer daylight hours and inspiring warmth and sunshine are changing the landscapes and outdoor activities of people living in the Midwest USA.  

So I will keep my home in the USA (Indy) and either rent or purchase another home in my chosen overseas location.  I prefer to own for sure and want to take advantage the many overseas property (real estate) opportunities which many like yourself are now and have been speaking of for many years.   Until I can determine which country works best for me and exactly where 
Within that country that I want to put down some roots in then I will need to do a lot of research and life experience opportunities about and within those locations.  Once that had been decided upon then my current plan is to utilize local and expatriate resources in the chosen location to assist me with residency and/or citizenship starting up my business or businesses as well buying real estate within that country in order to ensure that everything I pursue propose make offers upon complete and execute sign and agree to purchase etc comply with the laws regulations ordinances and standard operating procedures (SOPâ€™s) required and utilized by that country.  Also I want to make sure that I fully understand and that I am readily aware of what I can and cannot do in my new country and how my status as tourist resident or citizen affect those rights and what is considered illegal and/or non-compliant in order to avoid breaking the law behaving in ways or in manners that would be consideeed illegal culturally inappropriately or simply any misunderstandings in my behalf and/or creating or causing others in my new location to misunderstand me and my intentions due to my words vocabularybehavior and overall demeanor.  

At this time I still remain undecided on my choice for my future overseas location.  Therefore I want to be able to learn about and discuss overseas options which include Colombia but are not limited to only Colombia.  If that would not be feasible during that weekend then I am not sure if this would be the best fit for me.  
FYI.. the locations which I am considering are as follows and appear in order of priority but my perspective when forming this list is one of very limited direct experience knowledge and understanding all of the many critical considerations which must be thoroughly evaluated before making a choice: 
* Dominican Republic
* Portugal
* Colombia
* Nicaragua
* Panama
* Ecuador
* Argentina
* Uruguay

NOTE: I have visited all of these locations except Nicaragua but I only stayed in one or two cities during my respective vacations to these countries and my experience was limited to mostly tourist zones and not being immersed among the local population.  Therefore I cannot make my final decision based solely upon my own personal experiences in these countries but instead I must lean upon the experts available to me through organizations such as yours Live and Invest Overseas in order to help me make an educated decision using the best resources available to me.

All of the required research education and compliance information  needed for making this decision does take a lot of the excitement out of the decision for me to live overseas.  However I am cognizant of the fact that it is simply too big of a decision to make simply â€œflying by the seat of my pants.â€  Also there are far too many potential complications consequences financial loss and impacts upon my life in many critical areas if I am not making myself aware of or associating myself with local legal professionals and expatriates who could help me with understanding and complying with local and federal laws maintaining citizenry business and other critical compliance concerns regulations and other applicable legal behavior demeanor actions etc. required such as their SOPâ€™s.  It is very important that I quickly become very familiar with and get professional assistance with these legal considerations for both me and my company (companies) formed within and/or operating within the new overseas country.",2018-03-17,Dyer,
109005,94,Jim Rodgers,rodgersfam1980@yahoo.com,,,,"Dear Kathleen:

As in the quote below you indicate an invest-for-residency option requires placing $200000.00 into a DR Bank.  Understood.

My question is:  how long does that $200000.00 need to remain in the bank?  Is there a specific timeline?  Is it eternal?  Is it until you receive residency?  Other?

Many thanks

Jim Rodgers 
p.s. we will meet you and/or Lief at the Offshore Wealth Summit in DR in July.  Looking forward to it!

""The invest-for-residency option requires an investment of US$200000. However unlike economic citizenship options where the ""investment"" is in fact a donation to a local development fund you get your US$200000 back... plus associated investment profits.

To qualify for the invest-for-residency option you could put your money in a government bond which are currently paying tax-free (in the DR) interest of 6.7% to 7.3%. Or you could put your money in a bank CD to earn 5%.""

I went to Colombia 3 times last year ( including a Medellin visit of 3 days ).  Narrow minded people hold negative stereotypes about some foreign countries.  I felt safer in Colombia than many places in the US.  All you can do is try to inform the ignorant  gullible haters like LH.  Keep up the good work Lief.

We purchased a condo in Costa Rica in September of 2016. Thanks to your Orlando conference and of course you and Lief â˜º When we filed in 2017 we didnâ€™t report anything on our condo. Many factors why but most importantly our tax preparer was not knowledgeable about foreign real estate and we had only owned it for a few months.  Now of course we need to report for 2017. Question is file tax form 8938 or 5437? Iâ€™ve been reading Michael Cobbâ€™s emails that he has been sending out information on these forms getting very confusing for us. We paid $70000 for the condo. Also we have rented it out a few times. Nothing substantial but should we report the income? If so to Costa Rica or US? We have no foreign bank account only a Costa Rica corporation which owns the condo. The money is transferred by papal to our US bank account. Thank you so much for all you and Lief do!!!!!

It was a program that was instituted during the Kennedy Administration.  

There are companies that participate in this program.  Is there a source that identifies and does any research relating to these companies.

I am semi-retired and living on a meager retirement income.  Due to my parents health issues I have been doing everything I can to keep them out of a nursing home.  I have drained most of my resources.  I should have taken action sooner but it got away from me

I need to find a way to rebuild what has been spent if I am to survive on a about $2000.00 going forward.

My plans are to relocate to a Central American country but my parent's come first.  

Do you have any suggestions for this ""to late to start over guy""  who can invest/work from home?

I would like to diversify out of US bank savings accounts to overseas bank savings accounts.  But I've noticed in Latvia for example that the banks were quite leery of opening an account for a US citizen.  I think this may be due to the heavy requirements imposed on the foreign banks by the US government.  I am also an EU citizen and it has occurred to me it might be much easier to open an account using my EU citizenship.  For ease in opening the account is it skirting/breaking US law in any way for dual US-EU citizens to open bank accounts outside the US?
Thank you

109435,94,Steve,steveforbes54@gmail.com,6033939694,,US,"To quote the now infamous line from Monty Python ""And now for something completely different!""

I have been a staunch supporter of America since I was born. I've done my time overseas and spilled blood for it. However the country that I loved is now only a distant memory. The ship is sinking and this rat wants off!

Unfortunately I lost just about everything when my business tanked due to the last administration. Now the country is falling apart from within and I see no stopping it.

I am 64 years old have become disabled and not able to find work because if my health. All I have is my meager and pitiful SSDI. (That alone is a bad joke.)

(Mind you I want no pity. I'm just calling as I see it.)

I have made up my mind to head off to the Orient. I have no interest whatsoever in South America or any of those places. Instead I'm going full Asian.

My first choice is Japan. The reasons are limitless. The next one is someplace from my distant past ""The 'Nam"" followed by China. At least I can find work there teaching English. I have enough contacts and the background to do so easily plus I speak enough of those languages to get along.

You have except for a few earlier letters completely ignored all of the Orient. Vietnam is up and coming and nipping strongly at the heels of China. Cambodia is next. Japan is centuries beyond us in technology and socially. Their schools alone prove my point. My friends that reside there all hate coming back to the states for family functions because it is in their words like stepping into a third world version of the Twilight Zone.

So my overall question is other than your very obviously vested interest in selling real estate in South and Middle America why do you seem to completely ignore the Orient and the radically low cost of living in certain locations such as ""The 'Nam""?

What about the cost of living the tax responsibilities the choice of perhaps seeking citizenship there etc.? I doubt that I am the only one interested in Southeast Asia and the Orient. So how about it? You've spent enough time and effort on the Americas. Now it's time for the other side of the planet to have its share.

Inquiring minds want to know. At least what's left of one. LOL

My Colombian wife and I have purchased property in Cartagena and Bogota Colombia thru the help of Rich Hollman and contacts. Just came back from a DR trip and I know you have a upcoming seminar that I will not be able to make but I thought this might be of some interest. There is a new 92 unit building being built by three resort affiliates Wyndham Hotel Be Live Resort and Dream Style Resorts. Apartments will have access to all three resorts which are very close proximity to the property. Units start @ $75000 and up to $124000.00 due to being sold at a start up discount. Total project is around $10MM for the whole complex. Reason the resorts are selling this project they need monthly rental units. Many folks from many countries come to these all inclusive resorts. I have a sales rep {affiliated with ""Be Live Hotels""} by the name of Raysa Yanett Gonzalez located in Santa Domingo. Her cell number is 1-829-423-7606. The location of the property is Bayahibe DR. One hour East of Santa Domingo and one hour west of Punta Cana. Supposedly out of the hurricane path. Great beaches and wonderful resorts. My wife and I signed up to buy a penthouse unit {2 bedroom 88sq mt} Two baths and balcony plus roof space.  
This unit can be split into one large rental or two small rentals.
Ten units of the 92 are already sold just before we left this past Saturday morning.  The project just came available this past week. Also you can walk to a public beach and stores are in the area. I told Raysa about your organization and she is open to discuss with your team about this opportunity especially if folks are coming to your seminar in Santa Domingo already. Again Raysa lives in Santa Domingo and she has excellent English skills too. The developer has great photos of the project to show too.  They are planning a similar project to this on the North side of the island later on.  Let me know if I can help you with anymore information. My wife and enjoy all the work your team is doing in this area of expat information.  Sincerely Brain and Marcela Bosma Minneapolis Minnesota USA ",2018-03-26,,offshore-site-contact-form

I do have a bank account in Riga Latvia in which there are funds from a property sale there.  The funds have been more or less stranded there until I can make the trip in 2019.  My question is this:  What are the options to transfer USD from an EU country to the US?  Are their companies that can make such a legal transfer of funds?

I bought your last Mexico conference videos and am finding them extremely helpful but they don't address local Mexican taxes in depth (like when I sell my NY co-op I won't owe capital gains taxes in the U.S. but might I in Mexico? That would be enough to make me postpone Mexico move until next tax year).

Hope you're having a great day!

Myself Danielfrom an Internet Marketing Company. 

I would like to tell you some points about your online business. I hope  you wonâ€™t mind spending only 2-3 minutes to have a look at the following lines:

It seems you've been spending budget with sponsored listing or PPC.

. In PPC you may get the sales but only after paying a certain amount  every time and if you stop paying then the sales will be vanished soon.

 . In SEO You need to spend budget for few months. Once keywords will be in first page of Google you can get satisfied traffic for long time. 

. 90% of users like Organic results over the sponsored ones because these results are more relevant and valuable. So just imagine how many  valuable customers you are losing by not focusing on organic search results.

By investing a few months in SEO you can see drastic changes in your  website internally and externally. We'll show you TOP Rankings in your  keywords link popularity organic traffic and many more...

After reviewing your website I noticed some major on-page and off-page issues need to be fixed soon. For more information about your site errors please respond to my email.

I would be happy to provide you Complete Site Analysis Report (free of cost) with our Company Profile Work Experience and Client Testimonials. 

Our main AIM is customer satisfaction. We are not like others. We've limited customers and make it sure they are really happy with our performance. 

You may be interested with Big Big Companies but I can say they're taking money only showing their company brand to customers; otherwise the result part is Zero. Decision is yours!

We wish you the best of luck and looking forward to a long and healthy business relationship with you and your company.

Waiting for your positive responseâ€¦ 

Best Regards
Daniel Jason

It seems as if it changes every couple of years where is the best. From hypes of Costa Rica 10-15 years ago to various other places like Belize Panama Dominican Republic the South of France Portugal and many others. Do things change that rapidly that one falls out of favor or that another one gets better? Or are some of those countries still good but not the current hype?

We had opened a CR corporation and put our condo in that corporation. Which in turn you stated that was not a good idea. All of the lawyers in CR push you to put real estate in a corporation. What would you have done? Put in our personal names? If so wouldn't that be a breach of asset protection? Would you recommend us to sell our condo to us as individuals?

I read the happy adventures of some people but I think a lot of people like me would like a rundown of the things that can and do go wrong with overseas moves ... I know those things don't sell subscriptions or memberships but they ARE reality and highlighting some of them (the great unknown !) might help people like myself decide whether it's best for them to attempt such a move. 
For me I'll turn 65 this year and in pretty good shape but I realize that at this age I'm not planning to Yo-Yo back and forth across continents and most likely a move like that will be the last I will ever do.

The Belizean LLC costs $1000 a year to maintain plus headaches with their paperwork which cost even more than that!  Simply Natural tells me the lots have to be titled in an LLC.  This would mean we would have to move them out of our Roth and incur tax consequences (probably not much more than we're paying every year to maintain the LLC and Caye Bank account).  WHY can they not title it to the Roth in our names--Midland will allow this?  Can you help us find a way around this?  Thank you so much.,2018-04-04,,offshore-site-contact-form

Therefore we enjoy a lot you website your mailings and all the information that you prepare and deliver.

I think that you know that current economical and political situation in Russia push the middle class to look for the 2nd home&business areas and they need some info about different possibilities. 
We would be glad to become your representatives for the Russians. For example we could translate some information to russian language and deliver it using our channels. Also we could promote your services seminars etc.
Also my wife fluently speaks Spanish so we also could be helpful with this.
What do you think about our intensions? :)

110126,356,Rex Bontrager,rb@purdue.edu,7654943648,,,"Hi Lief.  We spoke at the recent Global Property Summit in Panama in April regarding investing via my IRA.  Because an IRA is necessarily anchored in the US you said that everything under it is subject to US jurisdiction even if I use a foreign LLC within the IRA.  For purposes of asset protection your final word of advice to me was ""Don't get sued.""  Still in your newsletter you said that the chances of an American getting sued is about one in three.  Similar comments have also been made by Mark Nestmann and other commentators that I have read.  In contrast I have also read your various asset-protection techniques described in the Simon Letter which I find intriguing.  My dilemma of course is how can I join the benefits of an IRA with some (or ANY) technique of asset protection?  Alternatively if I focus on asset protection is there any way of keeping the benefits of an IRA?

I will be attending the Offshore Wealth Summit in July.  This will give you and your co-experts a couple of months to brainstorm and hopefully provide some new ideas on this issue.  I wish you well.

I want to give you a heads-up about my experience with Simply Natural Investments.  I learned about them through your Live and Invest Overseas newsletter and we bought a hectare of organic avocados last June.  The person we were corresponding with Lillian apparently left the company and since then I am having a lot of trouble getting any information about what is going on with our lot.  Daniella told me in January that the trees haven't yet been planted and wouldn't be planted in February but she would have someone from the Farm Management team contact me about when they would be planted.  No one ever did.  I keep emailing her and she sometimes responds but her responses have been that she'd get right back to me.  I still have no information.  I value your recommendations for investments and have in fact invested in 3 of them (aquaponics in Thailand and the home construction in David).  I know you are diligent about vetting the companies you recommend so I wanted to give you this feedback about SNI.  I don't expect you to do anything about it; I just wanted to pass along the information.

Warm Regards
Sami

110592,94,Yoel Wasserman,yoelwasserman@gmail.com,,,,"Hi Kathleen

Weâ€™ve been following you since the start of our relationship in the early 90s. You were with International Living then and we were living in the Rockies. We were fairly young then and living from paycheck to paycheck; but the thought of living outside the US was always appealing to us. Chris would read every issue of IL to me out loud and that morphed to a custom of him reading entire books to me which he still does today. I prefer it to TV actually.

Since then we have been traveling and we plan on retiring to France in 9 years. I know French fairly well already having studied it throughout high school and some college. But that was decades ago and  I have never lived in a francophone country. When in France I always find I need to ask people to speak slowly. Iâ€™ve recently taken to listening to French audiobooks to get myself used to hearing the language spoken quickly. Right now Iâ€™m doing Lord of the Rings in French book and audio book. Iâ€™ll do several books with stories I already know then continue on to books by French authors.

Right now we are still in the early planing stages of retiring and leaving the US forever. Our plan is to retire in late 2026 and move to France in April 2027. We are considering the Languedoc-Rousillon area or maybe even Provence if we can find an affordable town. We check out listings on the Logic.Immo app every weekend.

I have a question to ask about our planning and would be grateful for any info you might have.

We are currently maxing out our IRAs and Chrisâ€™ TSP (federal 401k type account). My 401k is currently not being maxed out but that will probably change next year or the following. We have both Roth and Traditional contributions. When it comes to distributions Roth is great in the US and I really like the idea of not paying taxes on distributions. However I have no idea how Roth accounts would be treated by France. It would be terrible to contribute to Roth now only to find out later that we end up having no benefit from Roth accounts if distributions end up being taxed by the French taxing authorities. In such a scenario we would lose the tax deduction now and still be taxed by France on distributions. 

I am not even sure if retirement plan contributions are taxed in France. From what I understood we would be taxed but would get a credit on our US taxes for taxes paid abroad. But we have been following a blog from a couple who recently retired to France and just filed their first French tax forms. They seem to be under the impression that France wonâ€™t tax their US retirement income at all.

I have scoured the internet looking for definitive info but the info I find is either contradictory or irrelevant. Most of the articles I find relate to Americans working in France wanting to contribute to their US retirement accounts for a future undetermined retirement location. Our situation is the opposite. We need to find out if there is a benefit of contributing to Roth IRAâ€™s (as opposed to traditional contributions) here in the US for future distributions once living in France. If Roth benefits us in France then I would choose Roth but if it doesnâ€™t I would stay with traditional contributions until we retire.

Since reading the blog of the couple mentioned above I am now also wondering whether either of these two types of retirement account would be taxed in France at all.

I know that retirement is 9 years away but the contributions are being done every week now so I want to make sure I am planning correctly. I would appreciate any guidance you might have.

Thanks for your help

However I am frustrated that there are limited information available in the internet on this topic - the names of custodians / agencies that support this investment option where to start and how to proceed etc. I feel like I am going in circles. I would really appreciate if you could shed some light on this topic with potentially some referrals. I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks again for your time.  ,2018-04-22,,mailbag-2018

110726,94,Matthew,matthewdreiling@gmail.com,,,,"Hello. I am 21 years old about to be 22. I came across the Live and Invest Overseas website and I really love the content. I have a question however.

Here is my situation: I've saved up about $20000 over the course of the last few years (no debt) and I would really like to spend some time traveling and living overseas. I got my degree in finance and real estate and so using/renting foreign property to fund my lifestyle appeals to me and I feel like I would be great at it. However the Live and Invest articles seem to cater to people who have been in their jobs for years and have likely built up a sum of money... Is it still viable to buy property and live overseas when I am only starting with 20k? It seems like getting financing for higher value property seems difficult as an expat and i'm not sure exactly how much monthly income I could realistically make off of just a 20k investment. 

As far as moving I have visited both Africa and China and I love the idea of living overseas. Colombia seems like a great place to be but my perspective is still very limited. 

I would appreciate any thoughts you have on the matter. Email me at matthewdreiling@gmail.com or call me at 816.516.8975 - I would love to talk with you!",2018-04-26,,mailbag-2018

In the 1980's and 1990s our family lived fulltime in Europe for 13 years as corporate expats and for the most part loved it.  For our last  4-year assignment in England in the 1990s the corporate cost for us was $350000/yr+ when my salary barely exceeded $100000 per year.  Annual cost of living adjustments paid home leave emergency visits to aging Canadian parents  American international schools for 3-4 kids (the 1990 first-semester tuition in Paris for 3 was a shocking $43000 explained by their need for expansion capital) company car including European gasoline and insurance US-style suburban home west of Versailles with pool and tax equalization played the major role in ballooning the total.  Now we live cheaply near a major airport hub in the southeastern US in a southern ""ex-rust belt"" community near a busy Interstate freeway.  Not only do we benefit from the low-pricing you mention in your story but we have a 4-acre forested spread on the top of a local mountain with our retirement home on the ridge.  Our property taxes have never exceeded $360/yr.!  We fantasize about returning to Portugal for at least 4 months/yr. but so far just console our nostalgia with twice-yearly 2-week European stays.  We love your frank and wide-ranging writings about the important factors to weigh before deciding to become an expat.  Bob Stringham
Please note: In our company approximately 30% of the foreign assignments failed  with the family returning early usually due to the wife's inability to adapt to her new environment even in Paris. Often the spouse gave up her own employment had no pre-assignment briefings and unknowingly suffered from xenophobia.

In a recent letter you wrote about expat life in The Dominican Republic.  I been traveling there for 35 years and visited the country over 200 times.  I remember the exchange rate of 6 to 1 and a public taxi was 40 cents.  I do not believe that the DR is anything like Panama which I visited 10 times.  The DR would be difficult for an American to adjust to an expat life.  A few of the biggest reasons are:  The power is a constant problem black outs are daily The water is not good and no matter how much I try and avoid it with bottle water I can not avoid contact. To take a taxi is always an ordeal with no standard pricing.  There is now a lot of traffic way to many cars which makes moving around not pleasant. Also people drive wreckless many cars are in poor condition red lights and stop signs have little meaning. The people are great friendly and as nice as can be but there is high crime and children as young as 12 are always looking for the Next gringo to rob.  It can be dangerous walking in even the nicest areas.  The food is very good but boring and after a few weeks I am craving some American food.  The health care is  not good for a major illness and because malpractice lawsuits are unheard of doctors can be wreck-less. Am I missing something?",2018-04-27,,mailbag-2018

I have a small amount saved up but think Belize could be too expensive for me as I'll need to buy land. Also it may be too hot-I'm older now and have developed allergies against hot weather. The was things are looking I may settle in Guatemala where land is cheap. Do you happen to know if getting a business LLC in Belize is very expensive? I don't need a lengthy explanation about all the legalities etc-just wondering if it would be worth my while to stop off in Belize on my way doen there. I'd very much appreciate any answers you could give. I especially am aware that trying to skirt US tax laws are a very touchy and delicate subject there!TYhank you!,2018-05-01,,

The climate here is nice.  Not too hot and not too cold.
The Maderians are very friendly people and the living costs are still cheep.
Madeira is also very peacefull for elderly people.
The only negative thing here is the airportproblems with the strong winds and the hospitals.
But in the future we are having a new private hospital and there are plans for a new public hospital.
We are a danish retired couple and can live for 2.500 â‚¬ a month.
We have an apartement at 170 sqm. in the center of Funchal with three bathrooms four rooms a sittingroom a well equpped kitchen and two balconys.
Monthly rent 800 â‚¬ plus water and electricity.
We can afford a cleaning help who also do shopping and other practical things.
We also can afford massage in our house every second week and personnal fittness training two times a week.
We can afford to eat at restaurants and enjoy the cafe life very often and go for concerts and other cultural things.
And every month we canâ€™t use all our money.
Madeira have everything you want from life as retired persons.

I am a late  30's single guy from the US who has traveled a lot around the world speak spanish and recently have been traveling a lot to latin america.  My dream is to buy a big house or a hostal or small hotel or something like that so that I can live there.  The culture is so much better for me than the culture in the US and I do't want to wait until I'm retired to live there.  
I have a house here in the states that I could sell and probably have $100k cash.  But that's it.  That's all I've got.  
It seems that your emails along with International Living magazine and the like are directed towards retirees or investors and people who already have money.  Obviously you guys need to make money too so why target to the average Joe?
 So I'm wondering if you can help me to achieve my goal or how I can invest and make some money abroad.  I travel a lot and at least I can speak the language.  I get your emails about life abroad and how the US stinks and I'm with you man! But I'm not an investor (would like to be I suppose..) just a musician carpenter who has remodeled houses played in bands traveled the world but I don't have money from which to make more.  I could get a loan but...then what? Suggestions?  Thanks Arthur

110907,94,Kara â€œBedouin Babeâ€,adventureswithkara@gmail.com,,,,"Hello from the desert of Saudi Arabia 

Dear Kathleen

I hope this note finds you well! 
Perhaps youâ€™re still in France enjoying time in the cafe of choice du jour.

I am writing to you from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia~ KSA. I found you recently and canâ€™t seem to stop reading or watching your videos. Youâ€™ve inspired me so much already. So a big â€œthank youâ€ for being ~ you.ðŸŒŸ

I came across your article about reasons why not to live in Belize. I read it and half way through thought... this is exactly me- and exactly what I love - LOL. Belize... sounds like heaven to me.

After watching more videos signing up for your newsletter and reading other articles - I decided itâ€™s time to to reach out and say â€œHelloâ€.ðŸðŸ™Œ

My story in a nutshell~
Originally from USA - I moved a lot with my family as a child so moving is natural for me. 
I was raised in the â€œsouthâ€ and still call Kentucky â€œhomeâ€ although we moved prior to that state as a young girl. 
I moved to Manhattan for college and Santa Monica as an adult to work. 
I considered Santa Monica my favorite place in the entire world until a few years ago. I visited both Bali and Dubai/ Abu Dhabi on one long trip and said â€œsomewhere else like Ubud is now my favorite placeâ€....

When I was 18 I traveled to Europe for the first time (before the euro Iâ€™m dating myself ;)
Since then Iâ€™ve traveled to over 25 countries and now have lived abroad in both China (last year) and KSA currently.

Did I mention I love to travel?... :)

My work- I have over 1000 hours training in the  wellness and fitness world specializing in yoga holistic nutrition and supporting womenâ€™s health (emotionally physically mentally spiritually). I had a private practice based in Santa Monica where I also traveled to see my private clients in Aspen Nashville and New York. 
Did I mention my natural habitat is - traveling and being somewhere new :)

Today- after growing up watching people my age and older buy homes and have mortgages... I just never â€œwanted thatâ€. Iâ€™m a happy homemaker... wherever I go- be it an air bnb for one week or 4 weeks in Thailand in a cute hut on the beach.
I came to the kingdom (for fun) and for another adventure- as that is what â€œlife stageâ€ I am in- life is just one more adventure. I teach yoga and holistic health and PE in a private girls high school. What a blast with my teens!
I am here for one more year on my contract. After who knows the world IS my oyster. I adore living as an expat and donâ€™t plan on living (only visiting) in the US for ... ever...?

I believe now investing in a modest property (Iâ€™ve got my eyes on Belize currently) would make sense. Iâ€™m coming to visit Belize this summer- to check it out on my (summer break) before next years school begins.

This summer Iâ€™ll spend a few weeks down their in late June to see if I like the vibe- and next summer- I believe Iâ€™d like to buy my first property there- solely to rent and begin my overseas property portfolio :)
(Wow that sounds good and sooo grown up)
LOL

YOU- have inspired me. Thank you!ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–

PS I may take another teaching gig in another high school in Dubai after my contract ends. I actually have fun doing it the lifestyle is good pay is not bad and I can also build my expat life coaching business online in the meantime.
..... I miss having wellness clients- so Iâ€™ll do it online- why not?! :)

My idea... is keep traveling and working abroad and keep buying in Belize ... (Nicaragua/ Cuenca/ Medellin?)

Letâ€™s see ðŸðŸ‘ðŸ

I would be honored to meet you for tea one day. 
Iâ€™d like to follow in your footsteps and perhaps be an apprentice of some sort- if that tickles your fancy.ðŸ’«

Iâ€™d love to hear back from you or if not- I know you must get a lot of notes daily ;)
Iâ€™ll simply keep you posted on my doings :)

Have a glorious day afternoon evening wherever you are in the world!ðŸŒŽðŸŒðŸŒ

CheersðŸ˜˜
Kara

We'd like to have you as a guest to discuss the basics of retiring overseas.  We could do this live or as a prerecord.  Could you please have someone reach out to me at the email address above to discuss a date and time to schedule a short 15 minute chat?

110988,376,Marshall Hornstein,alainsome@gmail.com,,,United States,"Marc - It appears there are 2 GW Pharmaceutical stocks available. One on the NASDAQ (GWPH) which is the one you seem to be recommending. There is another  which is a pink sheet OTC stock symbol: GWPRF. They appear to be the same UK company. What is the difference? Their charts track each other. 

Thank you kindly
